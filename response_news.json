You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Olivia Dean\u2019s Man I Need wins Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 British pop sensation Olivia Dean has taken out the number one spot in Australia\u2019s largest music poll, Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, with her single Man I Need. The breezy neo-soul hit, which has spent 10 consecutive weeks atop the Aria singles chart, was widely tipped as the favourite to win the 2025 vote, in which 2.1m votes were cast. Dean finished ahead of Australian artist Keli Holiday, whose TikTok-fuelled earworm Dancing2 claimed No 2. The top five was completed by British singer Raye\u2019s worldwide hit Where Is My Husband! at No 5, Playlunch\u2019s \u201cbogan funk\u201d anthem Keith (which came with its own strong language warning) at No 4 and Tame Impala\u2019s Dracula at No 3. While Dean\u2019s victory came as little surprise, with a total of four solo songs in the countdown (and one appearance on a Sam Fender track), the standout story from this year\u2019s countdown was the strong performance of Australian artists. The 2024 Hottest 100 featured just 29 songs from Australian acts, the lowest result since 1996 - a tally that was surpassed around the halfway point of this year\u2019s countdown. Overall, 53 songs with Australian artists as the main credited act made the list, not including Amyl &amp; The Sniffers\u2019 guest appearance on UK electronic dynamo Fred Again\u2026\u2019s You\u2019re A Star. Fremantle band Spacey Jane scored the most entries for an Australian artist with five in total, followed by Ocean Alley, Tame Impala, Ninajirachi and Royel\".
