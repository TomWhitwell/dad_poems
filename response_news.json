{"poem": "**Cheddar Winter**\n\nRain has refilled the bowl.  \nCoots, the black clerks,  \ncount their small coins of hunger;  \ngulls and ducks make a white noise  \nover the drowned fields.\n\nI walked the rim for the rare face,  \nmistaking brightness for truth.  \nAt last a dark throat surfaced\u2014  \nEuropean or American, it said nothing.  \nEnough: water, wings, and silence.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Thousands of coots, hundreds of gulls and ducks, and dozens of great crested grebes crowd the surface, some already moulting into their smart breeding plumage, crests and all. They feed almost constantly, building up energy reserves for the breeding season. Among the throng are some less familiar visitors: a flock of scaup, the males bulkier than the nearby tufted ducks, with pale grey backs that catch the light. Flocks of goosanders dive frequently for food, the colourful males looking like a cormorant in extravagant drag. As I circle the reservoir\u2019s perimeter, I\u2019m on the lookout for a very special bird. The red-necked grebe \u2013 the scarcest member of its family in Britain \u2013 is easily overlooked, superficially resembling a smaller, darker great crested grebe. I experience many false alarms. Several times I think I\u2019ve found it, only for the bird to turn and reveal a bright white neck. Just as I\u2019m about to head home, the red-necked grebe surfaces just offshore, showing off its dark face and neck and a yellow base to the bill, to reveal its true identity. Or does it? Later that day, a friend sends me photos suggesting the bird might belong to the American race, which could one day be split into a species separate from its European cousin.
