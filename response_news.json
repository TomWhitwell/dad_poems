{"poem": "**Diplomatic Dawn**\n\nIn Oman's quiet cradle, shadows  \nof ancient sands meet the  \nwhisper of papers signed.  \nTwo voices, disparate, mingle  \nunder the sun's scrutiny.  \nHope, a tenuous thread,  \nweaves between them;  \na tapestry of words  \nfragile in the hands of time,  \nseeking in the vast silence  \na peace unspoken but heard.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Iranian minister arrives for mediated talks with US on nuclear programme Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has arrived in Oman for mediated talks with the US special envoy Steve Witkoff, saying there is a chance the two sides can reach an initial understanding that leads to a timetable for negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. The aim is to agree a format and parameters for talks that in months could lead to some US economic sanctions\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
