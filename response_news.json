When her Boko Haram captors told Margret Yama she would be going home, she thought it was a trick. She and the other girls kidnapped from their school in Chibok, in north-east Nigeria\u2019s Borno state, had been held for three years and had been taunted before about the possibility of release. Conditions where they were being held in Sambisa\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
