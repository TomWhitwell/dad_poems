{"poem": "\"Single Brushstroke on Dancer's Dark Canvas\"\n\nOf white clay and gloom, dancers sculpt silence,\nwhile the seizured heart stutters a low drum's despair.\nEach footfall, an etch in white-chalked darkness,\neach moment, a frozen pleasantry in the frigid air.\nYet amidst the icy gloom, a beauty rears,\nlike a lighthouse in the fog of Beckett's fears.\nSuch is the dance, absurd but fair.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

Cue gloom and despair, without even Beckett\u2019s words to enliven it. And when the 10 dancers of the French Compagnie Maguy Marin are revealed in crepuscular darkness, clothes white, faces plastered in white clay, feet dragging across a chalk-covered floor, I feared the worst.\".
