{"poem": "**Signal Lost**\n\nIn the quiet hum of wires,  \na silence looms, digital ghosts.  \nMeters faltered, like old prayers  \nwhispered yet unheard. Light dims,  \na cold hand on my evening,  \nas clocks deny their ticking.  \nEDF, a name adrift,  \na void of promised hands  \nleft grasping. Darkness waits  \nin the absence of time's tether.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I face losing my electricity but EDF can\u2019t replace my RTS meter I face losing my electricity supply at the end of June when the Radio Teleswitch Service (RTS), which controls my meter, is switched off. Every time I log into my EDF account I get a reminder and a link to book a visit for a meter replacement, but there are never any slots available. I\u2019ve been trying since December. On the two occasions\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "I face losing my electricity but EDF can\u2019t replace my RTS meter I face losing my electricity supply at the end of June when the Radio Teleswitch Service (RTS), which controls my meter, is switched off.
