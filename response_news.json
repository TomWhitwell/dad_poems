{"poem": "### The Madleen\n\nIn brackish waters, nations clash,  \nIron ships groan with silent screams.  \nHere, the prayers of freemen lost,  \nTheir outrage absorbed by darkened seas.\n\nYet, hope in one leaf's gentle sway,  \nSmall boats that dare where giants fail\u2014  \nEach protest a ripple, soft and clear,  \nDisturbing the vast, indifferent deep.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
