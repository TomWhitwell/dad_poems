The adult world seemed to be defined by determined, capable people making important decisions and I&nbsp;was desperate to be one of them. In short, I was precocious. And I\u2019m sorry to everybody I came up against. Especially my uncle Dan. Christmas 1989 was exciting for four-year-old\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
