On Friday, the UK\u2019s largest lender, Halifax, reported that the average cost of a home had risen to just under \u00a3300,000 after a 1.3% jump in November. After a pandemic, a cost of living crisis and a mortgage market meltdown two years ago, you might have expected prices to be roughly where they were five years ago\".
