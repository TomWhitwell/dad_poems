Before the outbreak of fighting in October, food security in Gaza was precarious, but very few children \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 suffered severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous kind. Today, almost all Gazans, of any age, anywhere in the territory, are at risk. There is no instance\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
