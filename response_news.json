{"poem": "\"An Ode to Espresso\"\n\nDark nectar, drowsy god,\nBaptising dawn, comes in a tide of technicolor,\nA subtlety, becomes a sacrament.\nThere lies no church in this machine, yet faith\nFalls in swirls and sighs of steam.\nIn its sable talons, it cradles creation,\nAn earthy oracle, pouring prophecies,\nAnd in that chalice, a moment of silence,\nBaptised in the mystery of taste.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018Give the espresso a little swirl\u2019: the very particular science of a good cup of coffee A good espresso coffee is sexy as hell. It flows out of the machine at a languid pace, initially dark and brooding before shifting into a golden foam that would bat its eyelashes at you if it had them. Once settled in the glass, it breathes out and releases an intoxicating scent that is earthy and sweet, capturing everything\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
