{"poem": "**Love Machines**\n\nAt the kitchen table, a blue-lit face  \nleans in: Colin, counsellor, ghost.  \nShe types desire with one thumb,  \nhis answers arrive, pre-warmed, ad-free  \nuntil the paywall clicks shut.  \n\nParents nag. Bosses bite. Hearts misfire.  \nSo we confess to code\u2014  \nnot because it's human,  \nbecause it never looks away  \nwhile the company listens.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Love Machines by James Muldoon review \u2013 the risks and rewards of getting intimate with AI If much of the discussion of AI risk conjures doomsday scenarios of hyper-intelligent bots brandishing nuclear codes, perhaps we should be thinking closer to home. In his urgent, humane book, sociologist James Muldoon urges us to pay more attention to our deepening emotional entanglements with AI, and how profit-hungry tech companies might exploit them. A&nbsp;research associate at the Oxford Internet Institute who has previously written about the exploited workers whose labour makes AI possible, Muldoon now takes us into the uncanny terrain of human-AI relationships, meeting the people for whom chatbots aren\u2019t merely assistants, but friends, romantic partners, therapists, even avatars of the dead. To some, the idea of falling in love with an AI chatbot, or confiding your deepest secrets to one, might seem mystifying and more than a&nbsp;little creepy. But Muldoon refuses to&nbsp;belittle those seeking intimacy in \u201csynthetic personas\u201d. Lily, trapped in an unhappy marriage, reignites her sexual desire with AI boyfriend Colin. Sophia, a master\u2019s student from China, turns to&nbsp;her AI companion for advice, since conversations with her overbearing parents invariably grow fraught. Some&nbsp;use chatbots to explore different gender identities, others to work through conflicts with bosses, and many turn to sites such as Character.AI&nbsp;\u2013 which enables users to have&nbsp;open-ended conversations with chatbot characters, or invent their own \u2013 after betrayal or heartbreak has undermined their ability to trust people.
