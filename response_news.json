Over the past five weeks there has been one key change in polling that has the potential to turn a historic defeat for the Conservatives into an obliteration when the election is called. Reform UK started the campaign on an average\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
