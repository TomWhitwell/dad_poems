{"poem": "In the Theatre of the Bront\u00ebs\n\nUnder the shadow of the moor,\nThree sisters with a forgotten brother,\nStirring bouts as in old folklore,\nUnseen pain, they hide from mother.\n\nKard's spectacle, in light arrayed,\nAmid the glare, their feuds we perceive,\nBut Bront\u00ebs' strife, in darkness played,\nYet, their genius in silence weave.\n\nIn quiet corners, words in air flit,\nMore than backbites, the pen is their hit.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
