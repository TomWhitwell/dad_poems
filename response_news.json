{"poem": "Title: Tread of Progress, Shadow of Regret\n\nIn industry's heart, a spectral hum.\nBanned beast, PCB, in clandestine drum,\nLike a silenced bell, still calls for vacancies,\nUnheard, unseen, but brimming with tenacity.\nFour decades past, yet our sin remains,\nIn phantom fervour, an echo stains,\nIn our hands, life's delicate thread,\nbut underfoot, nature's deathbed.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are human-made substances that were used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned due to their links to health problems and because they do not break down easily in the environment.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Cancer-causing PCB chemicals still being produced despite 40-year-old ban Industry could be producing more cancer-causing PCB chemicals today than at any other point in history, despite their production having been banned more than 40 years ago.
