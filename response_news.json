Scientists from the University of Warwick and other universities have studied the impact white dwarfs \u2013 end-of-state stars that have burned all their fuel \u2013 have on planetary systems such as our own solar system. When asteroids, moons and planets get close to white dwarfs, their huge gravity rips\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
