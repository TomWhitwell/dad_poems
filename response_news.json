{"poem": "\"A Drift in Isfahan\"\n\nRed dawn over Isfahan, drone\nscribbles in silent \nsky, so much depends on \nthe unseen wings, fire-borne.\n\nWhere old rules lay bare,\nbroken, on soil and sand,\nAs bird and cloud conspire,\nmen's hearts tremble in hand. \n\nA city cradles in its palm\nnuclear pulse, like a tender blossom,\nIn the game of gods and drones,\nIsfahan finds no ransom.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.

Isfahan is significant for its military-industrial facilities, the presence of an important facility in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and a major airbase hosting\".
