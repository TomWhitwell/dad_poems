{"poem": "\"Pathetic Fallacy in British Rain\"\n \nSunak, you navigate politics as one navigates storm,\nDragging Rwanda's name through a bottle-necked parliament.\nIn the sigh of ministers, echoes of unkept promises hum,\nwhile the sky's dismal tints speak tales of more than weather.\nPainted grey like the uncertain road ahead,\nPromise of progress wanes, yet, the house unhesitatingly nods.\nRemember, dear Rishi, there's more to a name than its whisper.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ocean Vuong.
