{"poem": "\"Rabbit's End\"\n\nIn quiet Hampshire, furred bodies lay, \nDreams of the furtive hare at bay.\nAmidst them, barred owl and kestrel share,\nThe twisted mystery of the village square.\nYet, knife of justice cuts the haze,\nTo unmask secrets in nature's gaze,\nDeath in fable, death so real,\nIn this serene, profound ordeal.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
