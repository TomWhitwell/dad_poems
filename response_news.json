{"poem": "Title: \"In The Arms Of Yew\"\n\nThere rests a yew, in Devon's lap,\nCustodian of twilight's cap.\nJackdaws dance, the day's retreat,\nIn hallowed grove where spirits meet.\nA confluence of life and death,\nWhere breath feeds breath, where roots sequester,\nAn enigmatic self-possessed jest,\nA tower, a pope, a silent tester.\nHymn to yew, in twilight's hue,\nEternity surrenders to you.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

I arrive as the sky pinkens and jackdaws assemble to roost. There\u2019s a sentinel by the gate \u2013 a prime yew, with a towering, pillar-like trunk\".
