{"poem": "**A Morning in Umm al-Khair**\n\nIn the gravel peace of breaking dawn,  \nA bulldozer's rumble rolls\u2014  \nAwdah's voice, now wind among rocks,  \nA camera's quiet absence,  \nLeaves a fading trail of light.  \nYet, beneath these mirage skies,  \nThe dust does not settle;  \nIn this solemn echo,  \nFootsteps of freedom pace onward.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
