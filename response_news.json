{"poem": "**Black Sea Lament**\n\nOil darkens the deep,  \nA slick shadow on salt tales.  \nShips flounder as wolves,  \nIron beasts scar the waves;  \nNature's cry drowns in silence.  \nHands gather in supplication,  \nFrail amidst this crude deluge,  \nEchoes of a bleaker storm.  \nHope clings to the fading crest,  \nAs if prayer could cleanse ruin.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
