The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling, and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). \u201cWhile the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherry-picking select documents, we\u2019re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said. \u201cFor over a decade, we\u2019ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most.
