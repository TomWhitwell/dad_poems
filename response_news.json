{"poem": "\"An Unexpected Bend in the Journey\"\n\nThe morning bus took him to Croydon, how strange,\nA routine turn shifting suddenly askew.\nMan with Sudanese roots, now walking Rwanda's range.\nThe unexpected path is seldom jubilant, new.\nIn the palpable echo of detained hearts,\nSpreads a whisper of questions, wringing the pendulum's sway.\nOne bill, one signature, where does our humanity start, where does it fray?", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
