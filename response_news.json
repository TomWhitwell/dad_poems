{"poem": "**Epitaph for Greed**\n\nIn vaulted halls of profit,\nwhere silence breeds deceit,\nnot wind nor prayer shall shift\nthe iron doors that meet.\n\nGreedy hands claw at the dark,\ncurrency their creed;\nyet in the soil of need,\nno blossom dares to mark.\n\nHope becomes a bitter seed,\nthe banks' thrashing greed.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"The horror, the horror: banks are having to compete for our business by offering better rates | Greg Jericho Banks, I know you will be sad to hear, are apparently doing it tough. So tough that they are starting to cut term deposit rates because they think the Reserve Bank will cut the cash rate soon and they want to get in first so they can increase their profits. Kicking the banks is pretty much\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "The horror, the horror: banks are having to compete for our business by offering better rates | Greg Jericho Banks, I know you will be sad to hear, are apparently doing it tough.
