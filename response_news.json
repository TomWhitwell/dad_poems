{"poem": "Title: \"Ode to the Receding Smokescreen\"\n\nOh, ye vessels of the old,\nFossil fuels, in tryst wooed,\nYour smoky emissions, once as bold,\nNow kiss the skies in softer mood.\n\nLess 8% your carbon waltz,\nAcross an orb danced in solace,\nFinding grace in your minor faults,\nDeclining, yet still with no lack of grace.\n\nWorld weary, yet greener for\nThe warmed embrace of peace in war.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

The fall in planet-heating pollution is the steepest yearly drop on record behind 2020, when governments shuttered factories and grounded flights to stop the spread of Covid-19, according to analysis\".
