{"poem": "**Whispers of the Hidden Isle**\n\nBeyond the well-trod paths of our maps  \nlies a forgotten coast,  \nwhere the wind stitches whispers  \ninto the fabric of silence.  \nHeather-cloaked cliffs watch over  \na sea frost-capped with solitude.  \nHere, the world unwinds itself,  \nand I find my place  \nin the wildness,  \nalone with the pulse of waves  \nand the secret language of stones.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
