{"poem": "Title: Farewell to Quickened Groceries\n\nPedalled triumphs o'er many a land,\nYet now, to Turkish soil return, headquarters stand.\nGrocery courier, tired and dusty,\nWhere once was bountiful, now merely crusty.\nCovid's haste fades, like spring into summer's warming,\nFast delivery's charm, in light of day, alarming.\nBehold, the capricious dance of demands,\nShifting sands, holding no stands.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

The closure marks the latest shakeout of the fast grocery delivery industry which grew rapidly during the Covid pandemic but has sharply retreated since. It is not clear\".
