{"poem": "\"Requiem for McGurk's - A Silent Sorrow\"\n\nIn the leaden cloak of '71,\nMcGurk's lament rang a bell.\nLost souls, children, innocents amongst,\nHarvested by the serpent's spell.\n\nFresh ink bleeds in justice's page,\nBelfast's forgotten scar renewed,\nUnseen eyes in nearby posts,\nTheir silence the depraved feud.\n\nLoyalist guns, their echoes still.\nThe state's collusion in whispers cling,\nYet, the phoenix of truth ascends,\nIn the heart of sorrow, it will sing.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
