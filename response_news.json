When the waters recede, crows and ravens will feast on the carrion of hedgehogs, dormice and other small animals unable to escape the rising water, he says. \u201cIt sounds very apocalyptic, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d says Hussey, a communications officer with the Devon Wildlife Trust. Between Tuesday and Wednesday last week, some areas in the west of the UK saw more than 110mm (4.3in) of rain during the storm. The deluge meant several places in south-west England broke daily records for January rainfall, causing authorities to issue rare \u201cdanger to life\u201d flood warnings. More than 100 flood alerts remain in place. As heavy rain and strong winds continue to buffet the west of the UK, conservationists have again been faced with the consequences of extreme weather for wildlife in a warming world. In parts of the country, some nature reserves are completely under water. Rivers have burst their banks; butterfly and other insect eggs will probably have been washed away; wintering and potential nesting sites will have been lost. \u201cFor the long-term health and robustness of our wildlife, it\u2019s bad.
