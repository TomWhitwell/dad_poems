{"poem": "\"Brief Ode to the Rain Dogs\"\n\nAt dawn's glance, Rain Dogs rouse,\nThrough a fractured Britain they wend.\nMother and child, life's touse,\nIn darkness, authenticity they lend.\nStripped of home, yet never hope,\nPens wrestle with their plight.\nCostello and Irish, down life's slippery slope,\nPerform a feat as night breaks light.\nIn their struggle, we find our own,\nAn ode to resilience, quietly sown.", "prompt": "You are the poet W.H.
