{"poem": "Title: \"Caught in the Thirst of Time\"\n\nSummer broils in south LA's stubborn poverty,\nSpeedy Cash seducing desperation's despair.\nTwo loan sharks, bleeding corners dry,\nClimate change's invisible hand stirs the storm.\nLines snake, await their turn.\nGuillermina, sixty, housed the world, now owns naught.\nHer pulse matches the ticking clock,\nEach beat, a surrender to tomorrow's debt.\nShadows grow longer,\nAnd in the summer's sear, we borrow winter's despair.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Climate change driving demand for predatory loans, research shows Two competing payday loan stores stand on the corners of an intersection in south Los Angeles. An area of persistent poverty, south LA is also a banking desert where payday lenders fill the gap. Long lines form inside the stores on the first of the month, when rent is due. Guillermina Molina, a 60-year-old retired housekeeper, visits the same Speedy Cash each month. During the summer\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
