{"poem": "**A Rare Moment in the Commons**\n\nIn chambers usually home to jeers,  \na hush falls like London fog\u2014  \ndebate takes on a human form,  \ngentler than the usual brawl.  \nTears line the corridors,   \nsoftening the edges of policy,  \nas reason drapes its delicate cloth\u2014  \na fleeting grace amid chaos' habit.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Vote on assisted dying summons ultra-rare Commons sight: intelligent debate | John Crace Who would have guessed? All too often debates in the Commons are partisan affairs, punctuated by jeers and braying. Where reason is superseded by dogma and ill-temper. This was a very different occasion. Parliament on its very best behaviour. Where necessary, people \u2013 mostly politely \u2013 agreeing to disagree. MPs heard in silence. Some in tears. Even more remarkable was the feeling\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Vote on assisted dying summons ultra-rare Commons sight: intelligent debate | John Crace Who would have guessed?
