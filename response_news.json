{"poem": "Title: \"Of Sharks and Shallows\"\n\nA hue of blue on man's domain,\nRespect, not fear, curbs our disdain.\nIn Cornish tides, a shark's swing takes,\nMankind, just toys in salty lakes.\nNo puppy's genuflection here,\nThrough prism of water, emerges fear.\nYet we plunge in the realm of the pristine,\nTesting the margins of the unseen.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018They\u2019re not like puppy dogs. They should be respected\u2019: how to swim with sharks in British waters We have only been waiting in the grey Atlantic swell a few moments when the first flash of metallic blue appears in the water. A blue shark, a few miles from the coast of Penzance in Cornwall, emerges from the depths. It is time to get in the water \u2013 but part of my brain rebels. Related: Migratory\".
