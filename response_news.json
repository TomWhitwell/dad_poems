{"poem": "**Curtains Rise in Tarantino's West End**\n\nTake your seats beneath the blood-red drapes,  \nwhere dialogue spins like a revolver's chamber.  \nOnstage, life dances on the razor's edge\u2014  \nhere, sermons inked in crimson unravel.  \nA tale retold in chiaroscuro,  \nwhere bullets and whispers share the script,  \nand memory, like celluloid,  \nburns brightly\u2014till the reel's weary end.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Please take your seats, the carnage is about to begin: what will Quentin Tarantino\u2019s West End debut look like? If the last few days have taught us anything at all, then it is this: if you want Quentin Tarantino to open up about anything, invite him on to a podcast called The Church of Tarantino. This is what happened recently, and the slew of new information offered up has been remarkable. Thanks to the podcast\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Please take your seats, the carnage is about to begin: what will Quentin Tarantino\u2019s West End debut look like?
