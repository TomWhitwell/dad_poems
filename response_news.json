{"poem": "### Stamford Bridge Dreams\n\nIn the tunnel's echo, whispers of gold,  \nBlue shirts moving, stories unfold.  \nBoots on cobblestones, a child's embrace,  \nMagic in chaos, a fleeting chase.  \nBetween roars and afterglow's clutch,  \nHearts learned to dance, felt the golden touch.  \nIn borrowed moments, dreams align,  \nBehind those doors, where legends pine.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

I\u2019d stand between the dressing room and the press area, so I got to hear the half-time talks and watch most of the Chelsea games. It was once every 10 days and still the greatest job I ever\".
