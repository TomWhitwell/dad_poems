You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"US labor unions gear up to fight against Trump\u2019s \u2018Billionaire First\u2019 agenda Donald Trump has staged a year of \u201cunrelenting attacks on working people,\u201d according to the head of the largest federation of the labor unions in the US. Now they\u2019re preparing to fight back. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said it was gearing up to challenge the US president\u2019s \u201cBillionaire First\u201d agenda in 2026 \u2013 and drive candidates in key elections to stand up for \u201cstruggling\u201d Americans. In an interview with the Guardian, she described how the federation has pushed to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers, and filed lawsuits against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to weaken unions and worker protections. \u201cPeople were pissed,\u201d said Shuler. The House of Representatives passed a bill on 11 December that would restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers in response to Trump\u2019s executive orders that stripped the rights from more than 1 million federal government employees. \u201cIt was through a lot of good old-fashioned organizing,\u201d said Shuler, who accused the president of overseeing \u201cthe biggest attack on unions in our history\u201d by moving to eliminate collective bargaining for federal workers. The AFL-CIO is now steeling itself for a fight to pass the bill in the Senate in January, kicking off what it likely to be another hectic year. The threat of another government shutdown looms at the end of January. The fight over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies is far from over. \u201cWe\u2019re organizing as we speak,\u201d said Shuler. \u201cWe\".
