The public outrage in the US about Epstein forced the government to release the files, including emails between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein now under investigation in the criminal case. The arrestee formerly known as Prince Andrew was accused by Virginia Guiffre with having had sex with her when she was a minor being trafficked by Epstein. He has always denied wrongdoing. Until his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, only his family had held him accountable for his ongoing association with Epstein after Epstein\u2019s 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. \u201cToday our broken hearts have lifted,\u201d Virginia Giuffre\u2019s family stated, \u201cat the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty.\u201d But while the English proceedings are yet to play out, others are still being protected from the consequences of their crimes and the voices of their victims. The simplest explanation of Donald Trump\u2019s furious, frantic behavior since last summer is that he has a lot to hide, and US attorney general Pam Bondi has proven eager to hide it on his behalf.
