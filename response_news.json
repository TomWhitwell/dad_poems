{"poem": "### A Country's Conscience\n\nIn the sunburnt land, shadows stretch  \nWhere hatred smolders behind smiles.  \nWords flicker, sharp as a broken fence;  \nRights tilt on a thin balance beam.  \nIn hollows of silence, we hear the cries\u2014  \nFaint echoes demanding a truer peace.  \nAwaken, oh heart, from indifference  \nTo guard the light of each fragile flame.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Every person in our country has the human right to live free from fear, racism and discrimination. Many positive steps have already been taken to address it. Some measures have gone too far, like the New South Wales government\u2019s law criminalising protest outside\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
