{"poem": "**Where Tourists Seldom Tread**\n\nMorning light spills on Carlisle's cobbles,  \nWhere footsteps echo softly in history's ear.  \nIn cities not swayed by grandeur's pull,  \nCathedrals rise like whispers, not roars.  \nHere, royalty once inked dreams with whimsy,  \nAnd where I wander, time itself seems to pause,  \nAs if nudging me gently to savor the past.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Where tourists seldom tread, part 16: a trio of small historic cities Whenever this town-focused series includes a city, prideful hollering ensues. The English distinction \u2013 not tied to a cathedral, a certain form of local government, nor population size \u2013 is whimsical, even if signed off by royalty. This selection of destinations is not about alpha cities. The smallest is ancient; the other two newly minted. None merit bypassing. Carlisle I arrived in Carlisle\".
