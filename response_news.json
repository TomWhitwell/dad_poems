{"poem": "\"Ode to an Unfinished Box of Chocolates\"\n\nIn the quiet moments of winter's morn,\nstraying hands chance upon forgotten treat,\nCrinkle of paper, a sweetness reborn,\nchildish delights that adult tastes cannot beat.\nFrom Quality Street to Venchi's high cost,\neach message inside a cocoa-coated post.\nAn echo of Christmases, some won, some lost,\nfleeting, yet loved, adored the most.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling introspective. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Notes on chocolate: lifting the lid on Christmas selection boxes Who doesn\u2019t love dipping their hand into a tin of chocolate at this time of year? Quality Street is the favourite, but while I love the childhood idea of them, they are just not my cup of tea any more. If they are yours please enjoy them. More grownup versions exist with more grownup prices. I have a soft spot for Italian Venchi\u2019s offerings. This\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
