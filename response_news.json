In the 20 years of writing the column, I have been reminded how many people are still out there, living their lives in quiet desperation about something that\u2019s really troubling them sexually. Often the solution is more education; they just need to learn something, or be helped to be more open about a problem. So many people grow up without the message that sex is healthy and important for a person\u2019s quality of life, and they feel guilty every time they have sex, or think a sexual thought. They haven\u2019t been able to enjoy sexuality and discover who they really are. Sometimes, it\u2019s not the sexuality that is causing someone\u2019s problem, it\u2019s societal notions \u2013 prioritising monogamy, for instance \u2013 that makes life difficult. One of the things I would have liked to have addressed more was sexuality when people have serious disabilities or illness. Many people think they can\u2019t continue to be sexual beings, and often that idea is pushed by people around them \u2013 that, to me, is tragic. As the column went on, I did start to notice that readers seemed to have a greater understanding of sexual issues.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
