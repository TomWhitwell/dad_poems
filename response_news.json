{"poem": "**Newtonian Politics**\n\nMorning paper, coffee ringed like a target.  \nTrump's touch\u2014mildew on marble, a name slapped on a hall  \nand the music walks out.  \nA newspaper trims itself into silence.  \nAcross the ocean, a boy scout prime minister  \nhires a snake for the serpent's court.  \n\nMeanwhile, Epstein's index cards flutter\u2014  \nand the clean man feels the bloodless bruise.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"There\u2019s one argument Starmer could make to save his skin \u2013 but he won\u2019t dare do it | Jonathan Freedland Everything Donald Trump touches dies. He put his name on the Kennedy Center in Washington, prompting artists and performers to flee in such numbers that the venue will now shut down for \u201capproximately\u201d two years. The Washington Post under owner Jeff Bezos sought to ingratiate itself with the second Trump presidency; this week it announced 300 layoffs and the withering of that once great institution. And now we can add one more, unexpected item to the list poisoned by the touch of Trump: Britain\u2019s Labour government. It\u2019s easily forgotten, but it was because of Trump that Keir Starmer appointed Peter Mandelson to serve as the UK ambassador to Washington. The prime minister decided it would take a snake to navigate the serpentine backchannels of the new administration and that Mandelson had the skill set. The result is an irony rich enough to make you retch. The Epstein files, which contain more than 38,000 references to Trump, his Mar-a-Lago estate and other related terms, seem set to bring down a national leader who is not mentioned by Epstein even once. Which points to a related irony, no less bitter. Because politics is Newtonian, with elections often won by those who represent an equal and opposite reaction to what has gone before, Starmer reached Downing Street in part because he was a boy scout \u2013 the squeaky clean antidote to the sleaze\".
