I ran for much of my 30s and 40s, then, when depleted hormones sapped my energy, I moved to hiking, Hiit sessions, weights and&nbsp;yoga. I felt occasional twinges, but nothing concerning, until one twinge became an ache that turned, in spring 2023, into a searing, stop-you-in-your tracks pain through\".
