{"poem": "\"An Ode to Wooden Buttons\"\n\nWooden buttons on trousers, a sartorial nod,\nUnder the weight of change, they seem odd.\nWhere is the responsibility, in our clothes or our hands?\nAre there bigger battles to fight in snowy or desert sands?\nBowed heads cloaked in yarn, delicate and fine,\nIsn't it monumental change, we need to entwine?\nSilent buttons, heralding the call,\nIn this battle for the planet, we all fall.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

We could be dressed head to toe in hand-woven yarns, but it\u2019s the bigger change that\u2019s needed. Wouldn\u2019t this energy be far better spent on demanding political action to tackle the climate crisis?Flora BainLondon \u2022 I\".
