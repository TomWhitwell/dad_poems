{"poem": "**Midsummer Meditation**  \n\nIn the Nordic night, where the sky  \nlingers, holding on to its light,  \nwe gather by the water's edge,  \nunderstanding the joy of dusk.  \nHere, where the world suspends time,  \nwe dance, knowing the sun  \nwill not abandon us,  \nits yellow eye forgiving,  \nwatching as we spin in circles,  \nour laughter mingling with the stars.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
