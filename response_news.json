{"poem": "**A Melody Beyond Conformity**\n\nIn a world of whispered chains,  \nThey scorn the brittle rust,  \nTheir song rises, untamed,   \nA lighthouse in industry's dust.  \nMelbourne's children of night  \nBear the torch of raw defiance\u2014  \nNotes sharp as stars puncturing  \nThe dreary veil of compliance.  \nTheir chords, a fierce refusal,  \nDance with destiny's own hand.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

The track \u2013 the first single from the Melbourne punk quartet\u2019s 2024 album Cartoon Darkness \u2013 is a brazen kiss-off to industry gatekeepers and naysayers. \u201cI think it\u2019s\".
