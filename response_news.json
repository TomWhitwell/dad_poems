{"poem": "\"Loss of a City's Voice\"\n\nBarefoot on time's bleak bridge, Hong Kong weeps,\nIts verdant voice, now repressed, silenced, sleeps.\nEclipsed by the leviathan's deceitful leer,\nStolen joy, sad song, waning cheer.\nXi, dementor of dreams, devours delight,\nPiercing the city's heart deep into the night.\nIn its mute mourning, a tale of power's cost,\nA vibrant vision, under tyranny, lost.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Lies, ideology and repression: China seals Hong Kong\u2019s failed-state fate | Simon Tisdall So farewell, Hong Kong. The vibrant, pulsating city-state that grew, under British rule, into one of the world\u2019s great financial, business, cultural and tourism hubs has finally been brought to heel. Browbeaten, abused, silenced. Trust Xi Jinping, China\u2019s dementor president, to suck out all the joy. Last Wednesday was the UN\u2019s International Day of Happiness. But it was a sad, bad day\".
