{"poem": "\"Of Life's Dark Shadows\"\n\nIn the quiet murmur of Ugley, a tale of sorrow unfolds,\nA tragedy etched on vacancy of a family home.\nBeneath the gavel's thrum, a silence broken and cold,\nA man in the pixelated frame, prison walls his somber tome.\nFrom Cambridge Road to Peterborough, a story starkly told,\nWhere pleas are not solicited, only the harrowing echoes roam.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
