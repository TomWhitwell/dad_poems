{"poem": "\"Politicos in Midsummer\"\n\nSunak and Starmer, a pair akin to a play,\nEach act crafted by silent muses in the fray.\nIn the throbbing heart of the battle, in political hay,\nLie a potent few, stirring the day. \n\nGuiding, advising, subtly devising,\nIn the painting of politics, their quiet advising. \nWhere words are currency, silence brings the uprising.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Meet the top teams: the key election advisers to Sunak and Starmer General elections are simultaneously an individual battle for party leaders and a mass effort by thousands of activists. In the middle sit the party\u2019s top teams, the half a dozen or so key aides and advisers who will play a major role in how the campaign plays out. Here we look at the personnel who will guide, advise and strategise for Rishi Sunak\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
