You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"More musicians drop out of Kennedy Center shows after Trump name change A second jazz band has pulled out of performing at the controversially renamed \u201cTrump-Kennedy\u201d center in Washington DC, giving just two days notice before their New Year\u2019s Eve gig was set to take place. The Cookers, described as a Grammy-nominated, all-star septet of legendary post-bop jazz musicians, have not given an explicit reason for their decision but in a statement posted on their website said: \u201cJazz was born from struggle and from a relentless insistence on freedom: freedom of thought, of expression, and of the full human voice.\u201d The band\u2019s decision to pull out of \u201cA Jazz New Year\u2019s Eve\u201d booking comes after the board of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts voted earlier this month to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.
