You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Young people: what rules around smartphone use should be put in place for children? We would like to hear from people aged 18-24 about their childhood experiences with smartphones and social media, positive or negative. What approach would you take with your own children, as a result of lessons learned from your experience? Would you let them have access to a smartphone or social media, and how often? What rules would you put in place?\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Young people: what rules around smartphone use should be put in place for children?
