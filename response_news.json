{"poem": "Title: \"In the Kitchen of Dissonance\"\n\nSmoky tendrils twirl away,\nFalse flags of hope burn astray,\nCookstove lies of carbon sway.\nCare's illusion, overstated day by day.\n\nBeneath the global greenhouse glare,\nKerosene whispers fill the air,\nLamenting stories of despair.\nA thousandfold mischance we bear.\n\nYet, in every human fume,\nMay blossom forth a greener bloom,\nDaily death to finally un-doom.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

Every year, an estimated 3.2 million people a year die prematurely from household air pollution caused by cooking with smoky fuels such as wood, paraffin or kerosene, which produce about 2% of global greenhouse\".
