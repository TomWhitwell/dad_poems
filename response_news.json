{"poem": "**Rabbit Trap**\n\nWales is not a backdrop.  \nIt listens.  \nIn the cottage the rain  \ntaps the barrel like a heart  \nkept for later.  \n\nThey bring reels and woollens,  \ntheir English silence.  \nThe child arrives:  \nface smudged, age uncountable,  \na hymn from the bracken.  \n\nThe tape turns.  \nSomething older than music  \nanswers.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Rabbit Trap review \u2013 feral child lends eerie magic to Dev Patel fairy folk rock horror There\u2019s an oscillation of weirdness in this feature debut from Bryn Chainey, who takes us deep into the traditional folk-horror thicket with a fervently atmospheric and intriguingly acted, if finally directionless drama set in 1970s Wales. Like Daniel Kokotajlo\u2019s recent Starve Acre or Mark Jenkin\u2019s Enys Men, Rabbit Trap swathes you in ambient sound design and insists on a kind of atavistic authenticity in the 70s stylings themselves: the woollens, the gloom and the analogue recording equipment. Dev Patel and Rosy McEwen play Darcy and Daphne, an English couple involved in the music scene; she is a folk singer whose last LP was called Mono Moon. They have come to the remote Welsh countryside to work on her new album, a bit like Led Zeppelin, whose experience recording in primitive Welsh cottages in the early 70s deserves a folk-horror treatment of its own. They rent a cottage featuring the kind of windows at which, in Withnail\u2019s immortal words, faces look in at. Darcy is Daphne\u2019s producer and sound engineer and tapes interesting sounds thereabouts for use on the record \u2013 birdsong, rainwater dripping into a barrel \u2013 but is also picking up a strange thrumming from the shroomy netherworld. Soon this English couple find themselves befriended and yet menaced by a smudgy-faced, jumper-wearing feral Welsh child (rather brilliantly played by Jade Croot) who could be any age from nine to 54, telling uneasy Darcy\".
