{"poem": "### Echoes of Jenin\n\nIn dust-choked alleys, shadows scatter,  \nas whispers of mortar punctuate silence.  \nPromises and protests hang heavy;  \ngraves dug by sunlit hands await moons.  \nRefugees see stars through cracked roofs,  \nfutures chiseled in stone and bone,  \nwhere borders bar and children echo  \nthrough the night, unanswered cries.  \nPeace, an orphaned dream, adrift.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
