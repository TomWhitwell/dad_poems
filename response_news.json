{"poem": "Title: The Sorrow of the Sea Rose\n\nA rose born of sea, harsh and worn,\nBattered by waves, its beauty shorn.\nLeaf sparse, petals few, yet with grace,\nStands sole against the world's vast space.\nFlung on sand, embraced by wind's song,\nIts acrid aroma lingers long.\nIn its solitude, it finds might,\nA beacon of resilience in the night.\nThus, thrives the sea rose, wild and free,\nChallenging each storm-filled sea.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
