Trump\u2019s belief in his own global omnipotence, and his desire to grab the territory and natural resources of other countries has been held in check until now by his fear of entanglement in foreign wars. He claimed (falsely) to have ended eight wars, and his greatest ambition in 2025\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
