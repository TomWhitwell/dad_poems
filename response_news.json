{"poem": "**Reformation in Englishtown**\n\nPotatoes still sleep beneath earth,  \nunder clamor of dragsters  \nand whispers of old battles.  \nJohn Alite, balloon-tied,  \nfloats past shadows of his past,  \na councilman's pen replacing the gun\u2014  \nEnglishtown leans in,  \na town of 2,350 souls,  \nhalf-breath eager, half-breath cautious,  \nlistening to the rustle of plans.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Former mob killer leaves crime behind to become New Jersey councilman John Alite has big plans for Englishtown, New Jersey, a small hamlet best known for potatoes, a drag racing strip, and the Battle of Monmouth during the revolutionary wars. But not everyone is certain they want Alite, 62, having a say over municipal matters in the town of about 2,350 people, where he was appointed a council member earlier this year and comes up\".
