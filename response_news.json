{"poem": "\"In Absence of Justice\"\n\nGone are the days, a fair maiden's grace,\nBotched hands of law, a morose embrace.\nWhere arrows missed, and chances thin,\nAn innocence lost, to darkest sin.\nThrough chilling morrow, their hearts grieve,\nA torment flighted, in tranquil eve.\nEnshrined in sorrow, yet spirits soar,\nIn justice's shadow, Joanna, forevermore.", "prompt": "You are the poet Robert Frost.
