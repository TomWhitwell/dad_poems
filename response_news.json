{"poem": "Ode to MH370\n\nIn the planet's blind spot, a bird takes flight;\nMalaysian, brave, into the unforgiving night.\nWhispers of radar, silenced in the abyss,\n227 hearts, for home they miss.\nTen years hence, we kneel and crave,\nTo know the fate of the brave,\nThrough the dark yonder, our gazes wander,\nIn search of MH370, we ponder.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
