{"poem": "**Lounge Lament**\n\nLeather perch with a flawed embrace,  \ntraded tales of seams and grace.  \nInspectors glanced, appraisers weighed,  \non behalf of chairs neatly arrayed.  \n\nA cheaper seat, the balance skewed\u2014  \nwhere coins slip through the cracks and brood.  \nRefund the cushioned difference sought,  \ncomfort, after all, is simply bought.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Our defective lounge was replaced with a model $200 cheaper. Can we get the difference refunded? We bought a new leather lounge but it had a major defect so the furniture store sent out an inspection supervisor who works for them to view the issue. Following that they sent out an independent assessor and subsequently advised us that they would exchange the lounge for a new replacement. The new lounge we chose was $200 cheaper\".
