{"poem": "\"An Ode to the Vanishing Vapours\"\n\nGas and hydrogen boilers stand in banned array,\nIn England's lands from 2025, they say.\nAll homes net zero, a clean and worthy fight,\nYet still revolves the orb in softest night.\nWhence heat without the hum of fossil fuels?\nA question posed to thinkers, not to fools.\nA challenge set by those upon the throne,\nWe look to heat pumps in the marrow's bone.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ezra Pound.
