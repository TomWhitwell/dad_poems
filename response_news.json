{"poem": "\"Of Compassion's Cost\"\n\nDeep in Europe's heart, a storm awakes,\nShadows wielding wrath instead of grace.\nHelp's hand is daunted by the face\nOf violence, a vile doctrine's trace.\nSilence, the reply to cries chased,\nWhence came this soul-numbing misplace?\nIs this the flag we choose to raise,\nA new age inked with fear's base?\nYet, amid the trials, courage makes\nA stand for justice in relentless pace.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
