{"poem": "### Cyber Monday\n\nA digital wilderness,  \nthis commerce without faces,  \nwhere hands do not touch,  \nyet grasp for things insubstantial,  \ndreams wrapped in wi-fi,  \na frenzy of electrons  \nas quiet as falling leaves.  \nTruth lies buried  \nbeneath reviews duplicitous,  \nand the soul, seeking salvation,  \nwanders corridors of code,  \nfinding nothing but echoes.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"The 34+ best US Cyber Monday home deals on bath towels, vacuum cleaners, toolsets and more Black Friday used to be known for crazy crowds rushing into stores and fighting over the best deals. Now, that chaos has wriggled its way online. Products now come from a hundred different brands you\u2019ve never heard of, accompanied by \u201creviews\u201d that might very well be written by the very same companies. Not to worry. More than a decade\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "The 34+ best US Cyber Monday home deals on bath towels, vacuum cleaners, toolsets and more Black Friday used to be known for crazy crowds rushing into stores and fighting over the best deals.
