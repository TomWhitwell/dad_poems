Shadows  \nSpeak, futures unravel.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"As the Prophetess of Doom, Rachel Reeves takes on the role she\u2019s waited for all her life | John Crace Onwards and sideways. Abandon hope all ye who enter here. To get the full surround sound effect of Project Miserable you only have to observe Treasury departmental questions. A place from which few come out alive. Presided over by the Ministering Angel of Death (AKA Rachel Reeves). Dressed all in black like some latter day\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
