{"poem": "\"In Swift Passage of Time\"\n\nIn corners of Paris, a Swift melody climbs,\nWoven in cryptic lyrics, draped in twilight rhymes.\nDelicate in reputation, alone in the hazy glow,\nAn island breeze stirs in rhythm, secrets the city won't know.\nCurtains rise and fall with notes, iridescent and free,\nRevealing the shifting Eras, there echoes a plea, \n\"Touch reality softly, and let illusions be.\"", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
