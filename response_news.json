{"poem": "**Gift Card Economics**\n\nCurrency tethered, digits like whispers,  \nSipped from the gift card, shy and remiss.  \nMerchants concoct these invisible twisters,  \nLeaving odd coins adrift in their abyss.  \n\nBalance ruptured, yet never depleted,  \nDollars linger, in limbo they swell.  \nA clever arithmetic where value's retreated,  \nThe ledger ticks softly, the silence sells.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"If I have a small amount of credit left on a gift card, does the merchant get to keep that money? Why do so many stores sell gift vouchers that do not correspond with the prices of the items they sell? Often when I receive a gift voucher, I will end up with store credit of only a few dollars remaining, or I will have to spend a bit of my own money if I\".
