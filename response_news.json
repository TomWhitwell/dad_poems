{"poem": "**The Rise**\n\nWarmer waters swell like a secret whispered,  \nocean's breath deepens, sighs into shores,  \nglacial voices softened, melting into memory.  \nThe earth tilts unseen, beneath a sky stretched  \ntaut and shimmering. Just fractions, fingers  \nof a wave's rise, tracing silent signatures  \non tidal calendars, centuries carving  \nan epitaph, a liquid monument.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Weatherwatch: warmer water drives higher-than-expected rise in sea level Normally, two-thirds of sea level rise is due to melting ice from mountain glaciers and Greenland and Antarctic ice caps, and one-third from the thermal expansion of the oceans. Last year, the hottest year on record, this was reversed, with warmer water accounting for two-thirds of the sea level rise of 0.59cm (0.23in) \u2013 considerably more than the 0.43cm scientists were expecting. Nasa, the US agency\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
