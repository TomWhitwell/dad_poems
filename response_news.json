{"poem": "\"Sketchings at Dusk\"\n\nA hush swallows the meadow, a bedtime psalm for grass,\nEcstatic in hoarfrost's icy hymnal. Nine raptors obeying \nThe unwritten laws of dusk in an ash tree stripped bare,\nTheir silhouettes, frozen strokes against a waning blush.\nNight swaddles the meadow, but their mournful cries, \nLike unexpected echoes, ripple through the cold, \nRendering breathless the silence of twilight.", "prompt": "You are the poet John Ashbery.

It\u2019s cold but I daren\u2019t move, for I\u2019m not the only watcher in the gloaming. In a leafless ash on the edge of the wood, I count nine raptors silhouetted against a pallid pink sunset. Their motionless bulk is unnerving; their mournful mewing shrills through the icy air. How many\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
