The lawsuit says Ramirez Sanan and her children were detained while accompanying her brother-in-law to a court hearing in Chelsea, Massachusetts, on 26 September. When they arrived at the courthouse four unmarked ICE vehicles \u201csurrounded and blocked\u201d Ramirez Sanan\u2019s car, according to the lawsuit. \u201cWithin seconds, and without stopping to identify themselves, ask any questions, or give any warnings or orders for the passengers to follow, the officers surrounded the car and used a sharp tool to shatter both the front and back windows on the driver side, hitting Ramirez Sanan and [her brother-in-law] with shards of glass,\u201d the lawsuit says. Lawyers said ICE officers then \u201cthen violently arrested Ramirez Sanan\u201d, \u201cby forcefully twisting her arms back to handcuff her, kicking her, and smashing her against the ground face-first \u2013 all in front of her terrified children\u201d. \u201cThe officers also reached into the car to unbuckle her 13-year-old son\u2019s seatbelt and grabbed his arms to forcibly pull the child \u2013 who is on the autism spectrum \u2013 out of the car,\u201d lawyers for Ramirez Sanan, 50, said.\".
