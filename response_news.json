{"poem": "\"Brief Elegy for Veronica\"\n\nIn Broxburn, a bird has stopped singing,\nThe embers of her song dwindling amid the mundane.\nNamed Veronica but hailed as Chitsidzo,\nFrom Zimbabwe's golden hues to the grey of West Lothian.\nA 7.55 watermark etches the final chorus,\nRoyal Infirmary silent, motherhood sobbing,\nAnd in another cold court, a story gasping\nFor the breath of understanding.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
