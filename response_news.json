{"poem": "\"Celebrating Life Through Art\"\n\nSketches bloom from fingertips,\nRooted in history's soil -\nA portrait of liberation\nGrasped in steadfast hands.\nVisual voices sing tribute,\nTo strong woman, once bound,\nNow free in canvas and color.\nCompeting, yet each a winner,\nCarrying their prize in pigment.\nIn frames at Tate Britain,\nWe behold brave narratives -\nLife's rich harvest, echoing.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
