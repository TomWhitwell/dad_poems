{"poem": "Title: A Morning on Donoussa\n\nElias, quiet as morning's lisp,\nDirects us past the kafeneio's whisper.\nThe news, less significant than coffee,\nDisappears in the alley's shrug.\nHere, where houses gather like simple prayers\nRough bamboo and hewn logs cradle a view:\nMen debate, but the sea, unassuming,\nDoes not argue its blue impartiality.\nCan one, I venture, drive to such quietude? Not\nIn a car, but feet suffice.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Europe\u2019s best beach holidays: Donoussa, Greece Elias, quiet and unassuming, meets us at the tiny harbour and says he could drive us to the house but it would be quicker on foot. He directs us up a narrow alley past a bustling kafeneio, where people are debating the news of the day over coffee. One of a little cluster of houses, ours has a pergola of rough-hewn logs and bamboo, and looks out to sea\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Europe\u2019s best beach holidays: Donoussa, Greece Elias, quiet and unassuming, meets us at the tiny harbour and says he could drive us to the house but it would be quicker on foot.
