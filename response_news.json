{"poem": "**The Gap**\n\nIn the urban echo,\n     where steel serpents hiss,\nI fell into the mouth of \n     time's narrow abyss.\n\nFaces blurred by shock,\n     my form entrapped\u2014\nA twitch of fate's\n     caustic clasp.\n\nBodies watched in silence,\n     my mortal coil compressed\u2014\nLife's breath suspended,\n     death gently caressed.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"A moment that changed me: My body was wedged between the train and platform \u2013 and my mortality rushed towards me The first feeling was embarrassment. What had happened was yet to catch up with me. All I knew was that I was looking into an open carriage, my body wedged into the gap between the tube and the platform, while strangers were staring from their seats in shock. It was 2015. I was 20\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
