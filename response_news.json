{"poem": "### Silence in the Forecast\n\nIn the cloistered halls of weather,  \nthe voice of earth is stilled.  \nBureaucratic bindings coil  \naround the truth, tight-  \nlipped winds murmur  \ntheir dismay. Science,  \nin chains, watches  \nclouds form  \nwithout the  \nwhispered words  \nto tell the storm's  \napproach.
