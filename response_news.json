{"poem": "\"In Soulful Basements and Silent Garages\"\n\nSilent woman, in the shadow of abandonment,\nFind thine voice in the echo of artificial heartbeats.\nEncased in silica, a mirror of thy desolation,\nIn the mute exchange with Zoey, thy reflection.\n\nLike a moth to the flame of past's burning questions,\nDolores, you wander on the threads of electronic conversations.\nDiscover, in a doll's cold embrace, your awakening redemption.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
