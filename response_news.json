{"poem": "Title: A Sonnet to Spring Strolls\n\nLike ships unlacing their mooring ropes,\nwe step into the burgeoning day.\nSpring whispers in each bud that opens,\nguiding us along paths of May.\nWe cast shadows on trillium thickets,\nunder the calligraphy of branches,\nwhere horizons hide untracked secrets,\nlike surprising woodland romances.\nA snapshot of these green dalliances,\nheld in our hearts and not our lens,\nSpring, your elegant dances,\noutlive mere holiday dividends.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
