{"poem": "**Winter on the Felltops**\n\nGhosts of miners linger  \nwhere snow stubbornly clings,  \netched by sun's delicate fingers.  \n\nGarrigill sleeps,  \ncradled in silence,  \nits heart slowed.  \n\nOnce, voices thrummed here,  \nnow only wind's whisper  \nthreads through the stone.  \n\nOn icy paths, life walks cautiously,  \nwith memories chilled,  \nyet strangely vivid.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Patches of snow linger behind dry stone walls despite the sunlight that delineates the workings and ruins of these heavily mined moors. Garrigill village, once a hub of industry where 1,000 people lived, is now a quiet collection of houses around a triangular green. The Spine Race\".
