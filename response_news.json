Solitude\"\n\nMorning finds me unmanned by newsprint,\nIn spinning twirl of Russia roulette moments,\nBarely won by truth or dare disclosures.\nI ruminate on the Here and Gone,\nTraveling on the tongues of podcast prophets.\nWhere are we going?\nStuck in crannies of Bone Valley,\nAre we not echoes,\nStiff-lipped stories repeating\u2014 another day,\nanother disappointment.\nOur laughter\u2014 a hymn in the purple dark,\nYet, still lost.", "prompt": "You are the poet Jericho Brown.
