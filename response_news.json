Must. Never. Be. Again.\"", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative.

Remember the Post Office Horizon scandal? Of course you do. So you probably don\u2019t have much faith in organisations and government to tell the truth. Because on every occasion, what you get from politicians is a lot of hand-wringing. Bucketfuls of faux piety. Verging on the lachrymose. Not forgetting the sincerity. Always the sincerity. \u201cThis. Must. Never. Be.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
