How is it different to the previous Department for Education (DfE) guidance, released under the Conservatives in 2023? What is the updated guidance, and who is it for? It is, officially, just a small part of wider guidance for schools and colleges, titled Keeping Children Safe in Education, which covers everything from the basics of safeguarding, checks on staff and dealing with harassment. The section on students who might question their gender covers about five of the document\u2019s 201 pages, guiding institutions about what they should do in such circumstances.

The first is that the new guidance ends the 2023 document\u2019s outright ban on primary school-age children undertaking what is called social transitioning, the process whereby someone who is questioning their gender might change their appearance or dress, or use a different name or pronouns.
