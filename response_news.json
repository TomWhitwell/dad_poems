{"poem": "**Ballymena Unraveling**\n\nIn Ballymena's night, the mob flame-lit,  \nPetrol dreams in shattered glass.  \nBrick-thrown curses, angry with the grit  \nOf foreign homes, where fear amasses.\n\nFifteen shields hold chaos at bay,  \nYet ember whispers scorch the air.  \nIn the darkness, shadows fray,  \nA town's heart laid strangely bare.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

The violence erupted\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
