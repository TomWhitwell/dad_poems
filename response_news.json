{"poem": "\"Residues of Holiday's Lament\"\n\nBleating alarms stir remnants of sleep,  \nEchoes of dread bloom, sky deep.  \nRecollection's eve nestled neath sanity's keep,  \nRusted dreams packed, counted as sheep.  \n\nHolidays, oh! vast lands of silently wept,  \nIn traces of longing, secrets neatly kept.  \nRemember, silence is but love's debt,  \nPaid in fragments of pleasures unhad, yet dreamt.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ocean Vuong. You woke up this morning feeling dreamy. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Christmastime can be a sad reminder that many parts of the US are left behind | Jessa Crispin All my holiday memories begin with the bleating of an alarm and being ripped from restorative sleep into confused panic \u2013 who\u2019s dead? What\u2019s on fire? \u2013 until I remember and silence the source of the sound. I\u2019m bleary and weary, double-checking the bags I packed the night before. The holidays would officially begin a long way\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
