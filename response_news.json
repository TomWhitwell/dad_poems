Medicine should be understood as a single enterprise: evidence-based medical practice, with patient safety and effectiveness at its core. It should not be fragmented into categories such as \u201cbiologic\u201d, \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201ccomplementary\u201d medicine. Mainstream medicine does not, as implied, dismiss treatments simply because they originated in traditional practice. On the contrary, interventions such as tai chi, yoga and many plant-derived drugs have been readily adopted once rigorous clinical trials demonstrated their safety and effectiveness. Much of modern pharmacology has its roots in traditional herbalism, refined and validated over time. The medicinal gardens at the Royal College of Physicians in London stand as a reminder of how clearly this is acknowledged.
