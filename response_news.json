You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Tyler Perry faces second sexual assault lawsuit for $77m Tyler Perry has been hit with a $77m sexual assault lawsuit by a man claiming the US entertainment mogul used his Hollywood power to make sexual advances after he dangled a part in the 2016 comedy Boo! A Madea Halloween. The lawsuit claims Perry subjected Mario Rodriguez to repeated unwanted sexual advances. That allegedly included sexual battery and assault at Perry\u2019s Los Angeles home, according to the lawsuit, which claims film studio Lionsgate ignored the misconduct. It is the second lawsuit in recent months to accuse the film-maker of sexual harassment. He was previously sued by another man accusing Perry of using his \u201cconsiderable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic\u201d. The 56-year-old Perry\u2019s fortune is estimated at $1.4bn, stemming in part from a string of hits centering on the character of Mabel \u201cMadea\u201d Simmons, a tough, elderly, Black American matriarch. In the new complaint, Rodriguez claims he was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged the man to audition for the film, telling him: \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person to know and have in your corner.\u201d Rodriguez claims Perry later invited him to his home where Perry touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit alleges incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly \u201cput his hands on Mr Rodriguez\u2019s\".
