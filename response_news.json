{"poem": "**Strictly**\n\nUnder sequined lights, twirling dreams collide,  \nHope holds its breath as feet weave the tide.  \nCloth-eared flops meet the judges' gaze,  \nAnd stars are born in the crowd's praise.  \nProp shop chaos, time ticks away,  \nVote now, before their steps decay.  \nIn this fleeting dance, night's stories unfold,  \nGlimmers of gold on a floor never cold.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
