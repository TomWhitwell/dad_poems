{"poem": "Title: \"Eulogy for a Maestro of Unheard Melodies\"\n\nIn mourning, Negishi, karaoke king,\nDeath's microphone echoes an unheard ring.\nHerald of joy or spectre of pain,\nHis legacy in every amateur's strain.\n\"Do we grieve, or laugh, or sing?\" I ask,\nBehind every legend, a human mask.\nHe gave voice to the tone-deaf heart,\nA jest or mournful art.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018I hear a dying sound and realise it\u2019s me\u2019 When I learned that Shigeichi Negishi, creator of the karaoke machine, had died aged 100, I was unmoved by those who hailed him as a legend. Was his show-off box really worth celebrating? Maybe they were doing a bad cover version of grief. When I sing, it sounds like someone in pain. I\u2019ve always suspected karaoke is one of those supposedly liberating activities, proselytised by people\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
