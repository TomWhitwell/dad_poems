Where the early English kings fought off the Danes and where Churchill launched secret flights to aid resistance fighters keeping the Nazis at bay. But the historic earthworks, wheatfields and RAF base of Tempsford may yet prove no match for a chancellor\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
