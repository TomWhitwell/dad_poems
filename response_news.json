{"poem": "**The Journey with Weight-Loss Jabs**\n\nAfter the needle's promise,  \nI stood lighter at the mirror's edge.  \nGone, the regimented whispers,  \ncravings of old chocolates and midnight bread.  \n  \nYet now, free from the song of the jab,  \nI embrace this body's echo\u2014  \nA dance with familiar shadows\u2014  \na reconciling with hunger's tender ghost.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
