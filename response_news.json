{"poem": "Title: \"Injustice in January\"\n\nNo conviction, despite the reddened snow,\nWitness the policeman's tainted halo.\nBrighton nights whisper secrets untold,\nA dark parody of justice unfolds.\nOn holiday they feast, the wolves unchained,\nIn a play of power, insipid, unrestrained.\nMenaced by silence, the city laments,\nFor the sad tune of a life, unsentenced.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Police officer allegedly holidayed with suspects arrested over racist attack Officers in a police force that bungled the investigation into a suspected racist killing, allegedly went on holiday, dined and partied with suspects arrested over the attack, the Guardian has learned. The new claims come on the 25th anniversary of the death of Jay Abatan, 42, who was attacked outside a Brighton nightclub in January 1999. No one has been convicted for the fatal attack\".
