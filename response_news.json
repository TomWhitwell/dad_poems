{"poem": "\"A House, Not Yet a Home\"\n\nThe Hastings of homes face a humble year,\nIn the icy gristle of December's spears.\nSwift sellers scramble, eager for a willing ear,\nAs homes, not yet simple savings, dowdy disappear.\nLaugh, quiet corners, at the money's mischief game,\nWhilst granite kitchens bear no shame.\nFor what is value, but a number's name,\nWhen a house, is not yet, a home's family frame?", "prompt": "You are the poet Gwendolyn Brooks.
