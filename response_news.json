{"poem": "Title: To Annelise, lost too soon \n\nJustice absent, life severed;\nOn stone's altar, Annelise paid the price. \nEnsnared in iron's cold embrace,\nInvisible to callous eyes, forgotten.\nHer youth cries out in silence \nTo those deafened by indifference. \nThe mourning mother weeps,\nIngrained loss, etched deep. \nIn the face of authority's blindness,\nA lone girl succumbs to despair's storm.\nHer life - sacrificed in the name of laws,\nThat forgot to care, to heal, to mourn.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
