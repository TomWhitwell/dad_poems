Investigators arrested the man and two alleged accomplices last week. They are accused of taking the objects from the official Paris residence of the French president and trying to sell them on online auction websites such as Vinted. The head steward at the palace alerted authorities to the missing objects, some of which are deemed items of national heritage. The items are estimated to have a combined value of up to \u20ac40,000 (\u00a335,000). Most of the pieces came from the S\u00e8vres Manufactory in Paris, a famed porcelain factory that has been owned by the French state since 1759. Investigators began to question \u00c9lys\u00e9e staff after factory personnel recognised some of the missing items on auction sites. The alleged thefts are an unwelcome encore to a string of robberies from the Louvre and other French museums in recent months that have raised concern about lax safeguards at the country\u2019s cultural institutions. The role of silver steward involves storing and looking after tableware and similar items used by presidents, visiting royalty and other dignitaries. Prosecutors said inventory records made by the arrested steward gave the impression he was planning future thefts. According to investigators, the man\u2019s Vinted account included a plate stamped \u201cFrench Air Force\u201d and ashtrays marked \u201cS\u00e8vres Manufactory\u201d \u2013 items not\".
