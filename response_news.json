{"poem": "**Outback Chill**\n\nIn the vast expanse where red dust looms,  \nA breath of frost steals old warmth too soon.  \nGum trees shiver under skies of steel,  \nWhile whispers of white brush the blue hills.  \nOutback towns sigh in record lows,  \nAs southern winds bite and winter grows.  \nIn the heart of June, the world turns cold,  \nStories of ice in a land of gold.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
