{"poem": "\"Leaving Lelant: Along St Michael's Way\"\n\nStepping off at Lelant just as dawn stirs,  \nUnder a maturing sky, we kiss whispers  \nTo slumbered corners of Cornwall, awake now,\nBy the serenade of a thrush unseen.  \nIn pursuit of a pilgrim path, hearts tied to  \nThe rhythmic pulse of ancient tides,  \nWe tread new echoes on St Michael's Way,  \nA journey once our past, now our today.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

The early morning light is still intensifying as the distinctive, repetitive shrill of a song thrush wakes this sleepy corner of west Cornwall.
