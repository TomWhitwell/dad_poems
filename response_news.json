{"poem": "Title: Reverie of the Digital Crab\n\nElectrons constructing pallid crustaceans;\nTruth a bright jewel hoarded beneath.\nThe arcade dreamers spin their fables,\nKaleidoscope stars in Faraday cages.\nA joke their vehicle - terse, incisive.\nBut can laughter unmask the cosmos?\nUnderneath, a mystic ocean remains;\nNo game console plumbs its fathomless quiet.\nIn silicon scaffolds, I find no comfort;\nOnly a strange crab's Ersatz treasure.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
