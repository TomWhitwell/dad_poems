{"poem": "**Green Wheels**\n\nIn every teenage pocket, unlock keys,  \nwheels spinning freedom beneath wise feet,  \neach pedal stroke a note in city symphony.  \nGently coaxing tangled thoughts into rhythm,  \nharmony found in rubber and road.  \nPavements clear, hearts unlocked,  \nthey ride to fast food dreams  \nalong lime-lit streets.  \nNo beeps, no stray wheels,  \njust the sound of summer turning.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
