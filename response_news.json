In Great Britain\u2019s most competitive auction for renewable subsidies to date, energy companies vied for contracts that guarantee the price for each unit of clean electricity they generate. Contracts were awarded to 12 new offshore projects after ministers increased the amount of funding available to developers to help them deliver their plans without raising bills for consumers. The funding was awarded to 8.4 gigawatts (GW) of offshore windfarm capacity, or enough to generate clean electricity for more than 12m British homes before the end of the decade. They were awarded a contract price of between \u00a389.49 and \u00a391.20 a megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2024 prices.
