You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I see time as a grid in my mind.

If you say a date to me, that day appears in a grid diagram in my head, and it shows if that box is already imprinted with a holiday, event or someone\u2019s birthday. Public holidays and special events like Christmas and Easter are already imprinted for the year, and the diagram goes backwards to about 100,000BC and then forwards all the way to about the year 2500 before tapering off. It was only in my 60s that I discovered there was a name for this phenomenon \u2013 not just the way time appears in this 3D sort of calendar pattern, but the colours seen when I think of certain words. Two decades previously, I\u2019d mentioned to a friend that Tuesdays were yellow and she\u2019d looked at me in the same strange, befuddled way that family members always had when told about the calendar in my head. Out of embarrassment, it was never discussed further. I was clearly very odd. Related: I see sounds as shapes. Synaesthesia has given me an extraordinary ability for languages The funny thing is I\u2019d been working as a GP for more than 30 years before discovering there was a word for the way my brain worked.
