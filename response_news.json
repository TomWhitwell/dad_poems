You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Starwatch: Here comes giant Jupiter, impossible to miss The giant planet Jupiter reaches its closest approach to the Earth in 2026 this week. It is extremely well placed for observation and so bright that it is impossible to miss. Jupiter \u2013 the largest planet in the solar system \u2013 will be unmistakable in Gemini, the twins, forming a lopsided triangle with the constellation\u2019s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. Its diameter is more than 11 times that of the Earth, and its cloud decks are highly reflective, making it the brightest planet in the night sky apart from Venus, despite it being so much further away. It will be visible from northern and southern hemispheres. Jupiter will be \u201cjust\u201d 633m km distant. The sunlight bouncing back from the planet will have taken just over 35 minutes to cross the space between us, and about 43 minutes to journey from the surface of the sun to reach Jupiter in the first place. The chart shows the view looking east at 20.00 GMT on 9 January. A beautiful beacon to the naked eye, Jupiter will be close enough to reveal its four largest moons through a pair of modest binoculars. Small telescopes and binoculars with magnification of x10 or above should also be sufficient to see the planet\u2019s cloud belts.\".
