Patients were knowingly exposed to unacceptable risks of infection, the inquiry found, and deliberate attempts were made to conceal the disaster, including by Whitehall officials destroying documents. The 2,527-page report documents a \u201ccatalogue of failures\u201d that had \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences, not only\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
