{"poem": "Title: \"Bethlehem Unadorned\"\n\nIn Bethlehem's centre, the lights dim,\nAn unnatural, grievous hymn.\nNo choirs carol in candle-glow,\nNo trees, no tinselled snow.\n\nThe manger lies, splintered in strife,\nCutting through peace like a crude knife.\nWhere swaddled Hope, in a keffiyeh tied,\nSleeps in rubble, dream crucified.\n\nMust merriment kneel to sorrow's yoke,\nWhen cradle and cross are cloaked in smoke?\nYet, in stark silence, we shall remember,\nThe stark echo of a silent December.", "prompt": "You are the poet Seamus Heaney.

There will be no trees, no lights, no choirs or celebrations. Instead of a manger, at the Lutheran church in Bethlehem, the baby Jesus lies swaddled in a keffiyeh, half buried in a pile of rubble. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to celebrate when there\u2019s a massacre, a genocide, taking place in Gaza\".
