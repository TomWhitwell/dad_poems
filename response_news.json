{"poem": "Title: In Anticipation of Transient Delights\n\nEaster whispers from its chocolate crypt.\nProffering moments of honeyed warmth,\nSmall joys of creation, in boxed innocence.\nAh, but the hatchling, not the hare,\nBetrays the world's transient delights.\nThere in its sugared shell, the bitter truth,\nThat life is laughter in a candy nest,\nForgotten too soon amidst the January frost.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
