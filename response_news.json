{"poem": "Title: Feasting on Stardust\n\nIn the tapestry of Toronto nights,\nUnderneath the neon sighs,\nThere lies an eatery of delight,\nTouched by fame's ephemeral light.\nA tussle of titans; Kendrick and Drake,\nTheir feud, the restaurant's take.\nThe dish, a secret desire,\nStoked by social media's fire,\nKid and kin, they dine with glee,\nIn the crucible of celebrity.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
