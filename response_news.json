My six-year-old, for instance, gets through well over a kilo a week: for breakfast, she\u2019ll have it with porridge, sometimes with blackstrap molasses, while most evenings she\u2019ll have a generous bowl of yoghurt topped with frozen blueberries or mango before bed (ideally before teeth-brushing negotiations begin). To avoid excessive sugar and more processed ingredients, we never buy sweetened or flavoured yoghurt: just the plain, full-fat stuff that\u2019s packed with beneficial bacteria. So what is live yoghurt, and why does it matter? Live yoghurt contains active bacterial cultures, most commonly strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus thermophilus. These cultures help ferment the milk, which is what gives live yoghurt its tang, texture and digestibility, and they\u2019re one of the reasons it\u2019s linked to gut health. Clear provenance is sadly lacking in this test group, and while most of them are made from British milk, that counts little towards transparency.
