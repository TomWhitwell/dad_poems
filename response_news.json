{"poem": "Title: \"Margate Mornings, a Transforming Tale\"\n\nIn Margate's windy wake, a Victorian shade,\nDrinking dawn from Caf\u00e9 Louie's cup, seafront laid.\nSunset's whispers paint Turner's halls, within sight,\nCrafted flavours dance on Margate's changing night.\nDemographics shift as tides, food scenes wane and wax,\nYet, the allure of the wine bar, Parisian, never lax.\nWhy do I not tread here more? A question only the sea can answer.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative.
