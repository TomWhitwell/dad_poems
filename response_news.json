{"poem": "Title: \"Of Earthly Havens and Alien Solitudes\"\n\nAlien eyes choose earthly sheen, \nIn the secret world of the unseen. \nOnce in dreams of the tender child,\nNow in hearts where age has smiled. \nShadowed by the gaze of youth,\nIn age, too, lies profound truth.\nEchoing echoes of past delight,\nIn quiet old souls, stars alight,\nUniverse waits and wisdom endures,\nIn unexpected havens, home endures.", "prompt": "You are the poet Amanda Gorman.
