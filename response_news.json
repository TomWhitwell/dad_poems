{"poem": "\"Compensation Conversations\"\n\nIn the churn of digits and data,\nA solace, on the fritz, is missed.\nA burden to the broadband saviour,\nA pound and penny sealed with a fist.\n\nA promise written on shifting pixels, \nSums unclaimed for connections lost,\nIn the static and silence, a universal fix,\nA missed installation, a day's silent cost.\n\nEvery minor outage, an echoed cry,\nFor the human voice, in a data sea, cast adrift.\nEntitled to more than a silent sky,\nA digital lament, a modern myth.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Under the telecoms regulator\u2019s \u201cautomatic compensation\u201d scheme, customers should receive set daily payments of up to \u00a39.76 if an internet outage is not rectified after two days, or if an installation date is missed. They should also be paid\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Still offline?
