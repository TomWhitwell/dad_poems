{"poem": "\"Conception of Childhood Dreams\"\n\nIn a barn worn by time, unpretentious creation,\nPuppets spun with love, birthing narration.\nUnusual voices, echoed amid rusted Meccano,\nThrough the clank of The Clangers, secrets of the pigsty echo.\nInside Emily Firmin, a brush with Noggin the Nog\nColouring corners of childhood, in barn and bog.\nWhir of fantasy, silent amid the morning's loftiness,\nWoven in the web of a memory's softness.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Oliver did the stories and voices while Dad made puppets and artwork. They filmed The Clangers in our barn, and behind it was Oliver\u2019s studio in a converted pigsty. As a child, I would hear the weirdest noises\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
