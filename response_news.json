{"poem": "Title: Fleeting Mortality in a Brash Symphony\n\nIn the newspaper's cacophony, a melody dark as Kentucky coal;\nRaving mad grief, the incendiary lament of a lover's toll. \nA tear in life's fabric unfolds a tale stark and tragic,\nGames of the gods, of death, ecstasy, and metalcore magic.\nThrough haunted notes and strident clashes they unveil,\nThe omnipresent waltz between the peaceable life and ghastly tale.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
