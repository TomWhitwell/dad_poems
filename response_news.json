Each is owned and cared for by a New Forest commoner, and grazes the forest thanks to ancient rights in use for more than a millennium. Different cuts of tail (a harmless practice) determine which agister (local official) they fall\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
