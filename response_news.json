The school quickly became the prime destination for clown training, attracting theatre students, actors and curious others from around the world. Philippe, who has died aged 82 following a lung infection, made the concept of le jeu \u2013 play \u2013 central to his teaching. For him, comedy was not about jokes but about danger: the moment when a performer risks failure or ridicule in pursuit of delight. His clowns were not sentimental innocents but mischievous creatures who loved the audience and longed to be loved in return. He was equally celebrated for bouffon \u2013 a grotesque, satirical form in which performers mock power and hypocrisy. Bouffons are savage but playful critics of society, generating shocking laughter from the darkest material. There were also courses in melodrama, Shakespeare, Chekhov, neutral mask, tragedy and vaudeville. It would not occur to Philippe to claim credit for the success of alumni including Sacha Baron Cohen, Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Simon McBurney, Kathryn Hunter, Roberto Benigni, David Schwimmer, Geoffrey Rush and members of the British comedy and alternative theatre boom of the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cThey were talented already,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI only told them when they were lying.\u201d At the mention of his name, a common response would be: \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s really mean.\u201d I never found this to be the case, though he was blunt for effect.
