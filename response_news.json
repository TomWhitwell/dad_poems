{"poem": "\"In Communion with Salisbury's Stones\"\n\nStone whispers to stone, in hallowed air,\nAltars rise, substance birthed from dreams,\nCrafted by hands bridging ancient and now.\nShadows dance in the Spire Crossing, echo in Trinity Chapel,\nBathing in the sacred silence.\nTwo altars awakened under the cathedral's hush,\nThey invite the faithful, the wayward, and the wondering,\nTo break bread, and sip wine,\nIn communion with Salisbury's stones.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
