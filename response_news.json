{"poem": "Title: Morning Rife with Unrest\n\nCoffee pours, newsprint whispers unfold,\nIn shadow of a silk flag, tales are told.\nAn exile in his own land, Omer sighs,\nin the shadow of a border under foreign skies.\nCups of loneliness, filled to the brim, patrol the morning,\nDreams of home, war-torn and yawning,\nQuestioning peace, a painful jest,\nWaking behind the world's unrest.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018I can\u2019t drink my coffee and see the Hezbollah flag\u2019: calls for a wider war on Israel\u2019s border Omer Shita does not want another war, but thinks Israel may need one if his family are ever going to return to their home on the country\u2019s northern border. He has put his life on hold \u2013 living miles from his wife and children, working part-time from a laptop \u2013 so he can patrol the empty streets\".
