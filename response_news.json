Rwanda's yield.\nAn aid riddle, tied in knots of sorrow,\nbleeds the Earth, a wailing field.\nAlarmed, yet distant, UK, US,\nFan the flame, M23's cruel duress.\nMurder, rape, displacement keen,\nGoma trapped within the scene.\nFrom Rwanda's hand, a perilous dance,\nWhilst nations eye, in cold askance.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
