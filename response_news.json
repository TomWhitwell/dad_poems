You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"UK\u2019s largest union elects leftwinger who was expelled from Labour The UK\u2019s largest trade union, Unison, is on a potential collision course with Labour after it ousted a general secretary with close links to Keir Starmer in favour of a leftwinger who was expelled from the party three years ago. In a result announced on Wednesday morning, Andrea Egan was elected as Unison\u2019s general secretary, winning just under 60% of members\u2019 votes, against Christina McAnea, who has been general secretary since 2021 and has kept the union close to Labour. The change of leadership when Egan takes over next month could result in Unison, one of Labour\u2019s biggest donors, following another major union, Unite, in scaling back contributions and considering formal disaffiliation from Starmer\u2019s party. Egan, a social workers with decades of union experience, who was on the left of Labour, was expelled in 2022 after the party said she had shared articles on social media from Socialist Appeal, an organisation banned by Labour. The decision prompted accusations of a witch-hunt against leftwingers, while Egan said the move \u201cdoes nothing to support\u201d unity among Labour and unions. In a statement, Egan said: \u201cThis result means ordinary Unison members are at long last taking charge of our union. We will put faith in members\u2019 decisions and stand up to any employer, politician or cabinet minister who acts against our interests. \u201cTogether, we will turn Unison into the remarkable force for change it should be. That journey has begun today.\u201d Starmer congratulated\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
