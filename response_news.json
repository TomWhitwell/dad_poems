You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"My unexpected Pride icon: indie breakup songs said all the things I couldn\u2019t say to other boys default When I was a teenager, in the late 00s in central Scotland, being gay was something I experienced as painful made me feel overwrought. This didn\u2019t match the depiction of gayness I encountered in mainstream culture at the time, which was mostly very cheerful. Almost all of the gay men on my radar were comedians \u2013 figures\".
