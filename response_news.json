{"poem": "Title: \"The Scalded Earth\"\n\nHail 2023, scorcher year supreme,\nWhere iron sun struck hard and mean.\nMarked by fires blaze and ocean's steam,\nA hellish portrait, humanity's dream.\n\nA warming cloak of gas and coal,\nIgnited in the world's soul,\nWrought by the craft of human tole,\nWhere earth once green, now red as a stove's coal.\n\nThermometer's siren, our somber song,\nIn climate's choir, we sing along.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
