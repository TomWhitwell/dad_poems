{"poem": "Title: Under the Joy's Mask\n\nDread casts its long shadow,\non the holly-hued morning.\nA specter haunting the Yuletide cheer,\nin every cough, every jest.\nThe hearth is warmer, yet somber.\nIntangible enemy lingers,\nlike winter mist on the mourner's coat.\nSuch unwanted gift under the Yule tree. \nA festive pageant of statistics and sorrow,\nYet, we find strength, in the gentle\necho of carols against the cold.", "prompt": "You are the poet Jack Gilbert.
