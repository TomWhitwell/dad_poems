{"poem": "**Harvest of the Sea**\n\nIn Wales, the tide retreats,  \nleaving strands of ocean's green;  \na revolution quiet as dusk,  \nwhere hands gather, tenderly,  \nthe wet gifts of the shore.  \nIn bronzed tubs and hissing fires,  \nthe tang of salt and weed transforms  \nthe body, a communion with  \nthe fish, the crabs,  \nin this baptism of the sea.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Tide\u2019s out, dinner\u2019s up: why Wales is at the forefront of a seaweed revolution I am lying in a hot bath filled with seaweed. After a week learning about the stuff, collecting it, drying it, eating it, feeling it slippery beneath my feet, this is the first time I\u2019ve bathed in seaweed and, yes, in the steam and candlelight, I get it \u2013 I get what the fish are crazy for. The fish, the crabs\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
