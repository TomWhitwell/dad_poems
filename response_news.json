I call it a piece and crisps because I\u2019m Scottish, so basically for your readers that\u2019s a crisp sandwich. Two slices of bread, proper butter \u2013 you can\u2019t have crappy butter \u2013 and a pack of crisps and squeeze it down.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
