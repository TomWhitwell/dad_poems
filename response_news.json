{"poem": "**Unwilling Exchange**\n\nIn clinics where hope meets deceit,  \nRen\u00e9e's stolen futures quietly retreat.  \nEmbryos exchanged, a life's strange twist,  \nYet in this breach, a friendship exists.  \nTwo women stitched by tangled threads,  \nShared sorrows sparking bonds instead.  \nBeneath the loss, a seed did grow,  \nIn barren fields, friendship can sow.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Everything had always felt so easy for Ren\u00e9e \u2013 until she began trying for a second child.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
