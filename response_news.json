There are 6 million cats in Egypt that are kept as pets, and there are 100 million that live on the streets. And they\u2019re all missing an eye, or a part of a paw, or they\u2019re filthy. So I didn\u2019t go to the pyramids \u2013 instead, I bought cans\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
