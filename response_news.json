{"poem": "Title: In the Tide of Unyielding Time\n\nThe mariner, not villain but victim,\nTethered between surfeit water and ebbing hope,\nOxford's glistening mourner, his wealth drained\nBy matrimony's puncture, a life re-cast.\nNature, relentless, teaches its fiercest lessons,\nIn the ironic deluge of sorrow's river,\nAn echo of ten-year torment.\nIn the heart of unaffordable empires,\nHe finds solace, where reeds whisper his story. \n\n\u2014 RS Thomas", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Despite the earrings, tattoos, missing teeth and bare feet, he is not a pirate \u2013 just a man with an expensive divorce and a public sector job, living in one of the most unaffordable cities in the UK.
