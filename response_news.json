{"poem": "Title: A Lament for Brightness Missed\n\nPersistent, patient anthem's fate,\nA tale of numbers, cold and chaste.\nSongbird chirping at the gate,\nIn prosperity, no seat partake.\nOne hundred positions danced, amongst the great,\nYet pinnacle's embrace it did not taste.\nIn the shouts of weddings, spirit inflates;\nIn unechoed charts, a subtle waste.\nThe greatest tune without a date,\nEchoes disappointment's bitter aftertaste.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
