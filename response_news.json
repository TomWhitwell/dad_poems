{"poem": "Title: Seeds Once Sown\n\nThe maples yawn,\nIn the old country - sanctions bloom,\nPale, like the dawn.\nFour settlers, now in invisible chains,\nBear the scars of a contested claim.\nLand, thirsty from blood and strife,\nRich, yet mired in human life.\nBitter oranges grow,\nwhere olive trees once stood..\nA sorrow, hewn in distant crow,\ncalls for roots watered by justice, not by blood.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
