{"poem": "Title: \"Born of Borderless Echoes\"\n\nNeither from east nor from west,\nAn echo of old words, scattered.\nA seagull's scream on a desert breast,\nA prayer in a wind-blown chapel, shattered.\n\nAn exile of self, in tongues array,\nJhumpa's voice becomes the path.\nIn the silence of origins astray,\nShe weaves the world's sanguine wrath.\n\nSeek not the womb, but the tale's long hand,\nIn her, all landscapes converge and expand.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
