{"poem": "\"Verse to the Virtuous Library\"\n\nUnbowed, unsold, the vault of volumes held,\nUnder cyber siege, they never swelled.\nBooks of yore, of tales spun and told,\nTheir ransom not paid, not traded for gold.\nIn silent rebellion, courage unscrolled,\nAgainst shadows in bytes and the digital mold, \nThey stood firm, blazing bold,\nA British defiance, a saga to behold.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

At the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, we have long shared the view of our law enforcement partners that paying ransoms should not be condoned, encouraged or endorsed.\".
