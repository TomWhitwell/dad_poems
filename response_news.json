Thick stillness,  \nlike bread rationed, crumbles  \nbeneath boots.  \nSky's raw glare reveals  \na language of hunger  \nwhispered in shadows,  \nunheard beyond fences.  \nHere, the ground  \nmourns  \nbetween silenced steps\u2014  \nchildren clutching hope,  \nthin as dust, sift  \nthrough ashes for dawn.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
