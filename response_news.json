You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Toni Geitani: Wahj review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month Arabic electronic experimentalism is thriving. In recent years, diaspora artists such as Egyptian producer Abdullah Miniawy, singer Nadah El Shazly and Lebanese singer-songwriter Mayssa Jallad have each released records that combine the Arabic musical tradition of maqam and its slippery melodies with granular electronic sound design, rumbling bass and metallic drum programming to create a dramatic new proposition. Beirut-born and Amsterdam-based composer Toni Geitani is the latest to contribute to this growing scene with his masterfully produced second album Wahj (\u201cradiance\u201d in Arabic). Working as a visual artist and sound designer, Geitani is well versed in creating imaginative soundscapes for films such as 2024 sci-fi Radius Collapse, as well as referencing the shadowy nocturnal hiss of producers such as Burial on his dabke-sampling 2018 debut album Al Roujoou Ilal Qamar. On Wahj, he harnesses soaring layali vocalisations, reverb-laden drums and analogue synths to leave a cinematic impression. Opener Hal sets a plaintive tone with a yearning cello solo from Nia Ralinova and Geitani\u2019s melismatic vocals meandering over the slow, thrumming notes of a synthesiser. Its gentle mood is soon shattered, however, by the thundering drums and doomy synths of following numbers Ya Sah and La, the blast beat cacophony of Tuyoor and the industrial techno distortions of Fawqa al Ghaym. With its bellowing vocals and clattering percussive motif, Ya Aman and some similar fare can veer into Hans Zimmer-style heightened melodrama. But Geitani otherwise keeps a deft handle\".
