{"poem": "Title: In Praise of Starlings\n\nAmong the undulating green,\nstarlings form an aria.\nChattering like cogs unseen,\nmarking days in their gardenia.\nThey chequer trees with dotted song,\nblack notes against the dawn, fluttering long.\nIn labor or in still ponder,\nunder the Brighton pier they wander. \nMurmurations make a seaside sonnet,\nmy shed, my seeds, starlings on it.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Country diary: For the starlings, this is a tale of two cities | Kate Bradbury On the allotment, the trees sing with starlings, as if the birds were decorating them, as if it were Christmas. I listen to them click and whistle as I clear a bed to sow seeds. They chatter while I repaint&nbsp;my&nbsp;shed. They\u2019re famous for murmurating around Brighton pier, said to be one of the best places in the country to watch\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
