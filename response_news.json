{"poem": "Title: \"In the Gilded Halls of Governance\"\n\nIn the hush of morn, a President speaks,\nDemarcating dreams with words like stepping stones;\nStaunchly aid bound for Gaza he seeks,\nAnd Trump's shadow he brusquely owns.\n\nIn the echoing Congress, Santos arose,\nA silent pledge bound by the heart's decree,\nIn the folds of November, destiny's prose,\nWhat was, what is, and what will be.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
