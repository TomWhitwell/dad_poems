{"poem": "Title: \"In Disquiet Harmony: The Struggle and Silence\"\n\nEchoes stir in the valley of time,\nMen, women, left to clutch their creeds,\nDivided, they stand on shifting sands.\nOut, beyond the tumultuous divide,\nSilent is the songbird's threadbare canticle.\nOnce full-throated, now lost to the winds.\nAn anthem of feathered life in retreat,\nBurdened by our indifference.  \nMournful, underneath the Southern Cross,\nIdeologies spar, while nature counts the cost.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
