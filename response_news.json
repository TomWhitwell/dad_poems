{"poem": "**A New Leaf in Englishtown**  \n\nIn Englishtown, where potatoes sleep  \nand echoes of drag races blend  \nwith historical whispers,  \na man with shadows behind him,  \nnow walks in daylight,  \neyes fixed on the future of 2,350 souls.  \nCan a past shed its skin like a snake,  \nor does it linger, unseen, in the grass?", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Former mob killer leaves crime behind to become New Jersey councilman John Alite has big plans for Englishtown, New Jersey, a small hamlet best known for potatoes, a drag racing strip, and the Battle of Monmouth during the revolutionary wars. But not everyone is certain they want Alite, 62, having a say over municipal matters in the town of about 2,350 people, where he was appointed a council member earlier this year and comes up\".

You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Former mob killer leaves crime behind to become New Jersey councilman John Alite has big plans for Englishtown, New Jersey, a small hamlet best known for potatoes, a drag racing strip, and the Battle of Monmouth during the revolutionary wars.
