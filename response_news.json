You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"The criminalizing of protest and dissent has a long history in America When federal immigration agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on 23 January, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, wasted no time claiming to the press, without credible evidence, that Pretti had been engaged in \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Though the administration seems to be trying to soften that initial response after fierce backlash, it\u2019s an accusation that members of the Trump administration have been leveling at wide swaths of people beyond Pretti \u2013 including Renee Nicole Good, another Minnesotan killed by ICE agents two and a half weeks prior, and Marimar Martinez, who survived being shot by ICE agents in Chicago in October \u2013 as part of an ongoing strategy to criminalize dissent. It\u2019s a claim Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents themselves have started to make directly in confrontations with citizens, seemingly to try and intimidate legal observers, sometimes known as ICE watchers. In one recent video from Portland, Maine, an ICE officer told an observer to stop recording him on her phone, and when she wouldn\u2019t, he took her information down and said, \u201cWe have a nice little database \u2026 and now you\u2019re considered a domestic terrorist.\u201d A common pattern has also emerged in courts: ICE or other federal agents will initiate a violent confrontation with a protester \u2013 pushing a 70-year-old veteran to the ground in Chicago outside the Broadway ICE facility, or shoving a US citizen at a protest in LA \u2013\".
