{"poem": "Title: \"Morning Rite\"\n\nDawn greets the child, eyes wide with fasting,\nNostalgic, I sip from the same cup once my father did.\nLove spools time in reverse, weaving lessons in its thread.\nWith every breaking fast, my children inherit stories,\nAnd in this moonlit Ramadan, even the keepsakes gain a voice.\nThere is something sweet in everything they inherit,\nSome kind of magic only found in family secrets.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

The excitement was building long before the moon\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
