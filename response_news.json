{"poem": "\"Towers of Industry\"\n\nConcrete choirs that sing no notes,\nArchitectural gems of a vanishing boat.\nLooming large against cloud-dappled sky,\nMonuments of industry, whispering goodbye.\n\nGraceful giants in their muted hue,\nCasting long shadows as the hours accrue.\nIn the space of memories, forever they stand,\nEchoes of prowess, etched in the land.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Britain\u2019s 45 remaining cooling towers are architectural gems. Let\u2019s save them Consider cooling towers. They are monuments of industry, built at the size (and more) of pyramids and cathedrals, graceful in their geometry, the perfect marriage of form and function, that come not alone but in concrete choirs of up to 12 in number. They are big enough to capture cloud shadows, in the way that hills do, and when in use make (or made)\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Britain\u2019s 45 remaining cooling towers are architectural gems. Let\u2019s save them Consider cooling towers.
