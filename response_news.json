This week, both Labour and the Tories will reckon they\u2019ve struck lucky with the timings of their manifesto launches \u2013 though for very different reasons. It\u2019s always hard to know which is the best launch slot. To go first and set the agenda, with the anxiety that everyone will have soon forgotten\".
