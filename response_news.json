{"poem": "**Ceasefire Refrain**\n\nIn Gaza's hush, arms lower their fight,  \nWhere bonds reknit in dawn's tender light.  \nFathers and sons, tears like rivers flow,  \nIn this brief peace, hope dares to grow.  \nHands released from chains of night,  \nIn their embrace, the world feels right.  \nA moment's breath, a fragile grace,  \nIn love renewed, find solace's place.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
