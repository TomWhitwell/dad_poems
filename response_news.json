But if we imagined for a moment that the 11th album by Sleater-Kinney \u2013 the evergreen duo of singing guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker \u2013 had arrived free of context, without the baggage of life events, its 10 songs might land in certain ways, and maybe not others. Perhaps the sharpness of its pointillist post-punk\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
