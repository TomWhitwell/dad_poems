{"poem": "**Heatwave Wardrobe**\n\nIn blistering blaze and fervent haze,  \ncotton clings like a lover's embrace,  \nlinen whispers secrets of shade,  \nwhile synthetic traps sweat's parade.  \nHeathered grey, in global scorch,  \nbecomes the sun's forgotten torch.  \nDress to endure, dress to breathe,  \nas earth's fever swells beneath.  \nThreads of nature, woven cool,  \ngarb of choice for climate's duel.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"What to wear in extreme heat: natural fibers only \u2013 and no heathered grey As you\u2019ve probably noticed, it\u2019s extremely hot. A heatwave has blanketed much of the eastern United States, and the UK Health Security Agency has just issued a heat-health alert for much of England. This raises lots of questions. What does this mean for the future of our planet? How can we best combat climate change? And also, what does one wear\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "What to wear in extreme heat: natural fibers only \u2013 and no heathered grey As you\u2019ve probably noticed, it\u2019s extremely hot.
