{"poem": "**Orpine Harvest**\n\nIn Carla's herb garden, balance blooms,  \nwhere green shoots whisper ancient charms.  \nShe clips the orpine, crisp and bright,  \na cucumber's kiss, a tart embrace.  \nIt keeps odd folks and storms away,  \nyet invites peculiar hearts to stay\u2014  \ntender leaves of savory grace,  \nfending sky-borne bolts, while savoring taste.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
