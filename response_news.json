You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Makers of Peaky Blinders \u2018in advanced talks\u2019 to merge with The Traitors producer The world\u2019s largest independent television production group, which is behind shows ranging from Peaky Blinders to Big Brother, is reportedly in talks to merge with the UK-based maker of hits TV shows including The Traitors. The Paris-headquartered Banijay Group, which last year considered making a takeover offer for ITV\u2019s studio operation, is said to be in advanced talks with All3Media, which is owned by RedBird IMI, the Abu Dhabi-backed company that is trying to off-load the Telegraph titles to the owner of the Daily Mail. A merger would create a European TV production behemoth, combining Banijay hits such as Survivor, Pointless, Hunted, and Location, Location, Location with All3Media staples such as Midsomer Murders, Call the Midwife, Great British Menu and Race Across the World. Reuters first reported news of the talks, citing a source claiming that a potential deal was expected to include All3Media injecting funds into the merged entity because it is the smaller of the two companies. Banijay was founded in 2008 and merged seven years later with Zodiak, the owner of UK producers including the Faking It maker RDF. It struck a $2.2bn (\u00a31.6bn) deal in 2019 to buy Endemol Shine Group, the maker of shows including MasterChef, Big Brother and Black Mirror, to create the largest TV producer outside the US. The group\u2019s stable includes more than 130 TV production and creative businesses across more than 25 territories. All3Media has 50 different labels\".
