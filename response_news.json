{"poem": "Beneath the Lisbon Sun\n\nLisbon with daughter's eyes, unfurled, \nCaught in the lens of a father's world.\nMarble memories etch in stone, \nEchoing labour that's seldom known. \nThe city's heart and story unfurls,\nThreading life's changes in delicate twirls. \nA cinematic ode, sung clear:\nLisbon survives, in love and fear.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
