{"poem": "**Shock and Awe**\n\nIn London, the room darkened  \nto a birthday's candles.  \nNot light, but confession  \nburned.  \n\nTurnage's music: iron in the blood,  \nno mercy, no ornament.  \nEach word a spade  \nturning the family over.  \n\nBeethoven after\u2014  \nriot of colour\u2014  \nbut still I heard  \nthe hymns of what we hide.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Shock and awe: our critics pick their best live classical events of 2025 \u2018One of the most remarkable operatic premieres I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 I was only able to get to live music for less than three months of this year, but among the few events that I did attend was one of the most remarkable operatic premieres I\u2019ve heard in more than 40 years. Commissioned by the Royal Opera, and based on the movie and stage play of the same name by Thomas Vinterberg, Festen was Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s fifth large-scale opera, and showed vividly how the sure dramatic instincts revealed in his earliest stage works, Greek and The Silver Tassie, have matured into an operatic language of immense power and flexibility. Not a word of Lee Hall\u2019s libretto is wasted in revealing the dark family secrets that are exposed at a 60th birthday party, while Turnage\u2019s wonderfully varied, unsparing score never makes a false step. The horror of the drama was remorselessly focused by Richard Jones\u2019s production, with a cast in which every role was made horribly believable. The best British opera in half a century? Probably. Andrew Clements Beethoven with a riot of colour and freshness Some highlights are more predictable than others. The Australian Chamber Orchestra has now been wowing audiences for half a century, with Richard Tognetti its maverick leader for 35 years. But not even that track record could prepare me for the raw vitality of the ACO\u2019s latest UK outing at the Barbican in March\".
