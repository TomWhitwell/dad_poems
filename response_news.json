{"poem": "Title: \"Wanderlust in Slow Motion\"\n\nOnce fast-tracked lives now unfurl slow,\nLike tussock's dance in breezy throw.\nEmbrace the journey, taste each scene,\nBlue tunnel visions, train's gentle lean.\n\nTales written in departure bars,\nLost in transit, beneath the stars.\nAirports echo hearts' chorus,\nWith each delay they store up for us.\n\nTravel not for destination's lure, \nRather the road's winding contours.\nFind in the journey, truth uncovers,\nFootprints etched in time, travel lovers.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

If the journey in question involves airport chaos, traffic jams or train delays that can be easier\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
