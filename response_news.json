Frail balance at the precipice.\nIts elemental breath used as collateral,\nFor power's hollow crown.\nChances, slim as gossamer wings,\nRavaged by brash rejection of truth.\nHis indifference, a monument of ice,\nMelting irrevocably into our shared future\nIn the face of the world's second deadliest sin.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
