You will, however, probably see it on a fresh college graduate, the guy shopping for his very first suit and, perhaps most prominently, New York City\u2019s 111th mayor, Zohran Mamdani. The city\u2019s newly sworn-in mayor wore the brand\u2019s everyman suits throughout his campaign, drawing commentary from the style desks of Bloomberg (calling him \u201cstyle icon\u201d), the New York Times (calling his style \u201cmillennial\u201d) and GQ (calling it \u201cUniqlo uncle\u201d). What they all agreed on: somehow, Mamdani pulled off wearing $500 suits on a national stage. Once upon a time, a very nice suit was a marker of wealth and status. Perhaps not quite in the same sentence as a Rolex, but certainly not something the everyday worker would own. It was mostly reserved for high-rolling business executives, the fashionable culture vultures and, well, politicians. And it still is to a certain extent. But, with the rise of e-commerce brands like Suitsupply and the internet un-gatekeeping the nuances of menswear, today\u2019s average buyer can easily find an attainable but well-made option for this signifier of prestige and polish. \u201cIf you know how to shop for clothes, you can get a better suit at $300 than some guy who has no idea what he\u2019s doing [and] is spending $10,000,\u201d says Derek Guy, a menswear writer better known to some as the viral \u201cmenswear guy\u201d on social\".
