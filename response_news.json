{"poem": "Title: In Memoriam: A Literary Emulsion \n\nGone, she, who held dusk and dawn as twins - tales of parchment, ink of tears. Africa to Oxford's arms, a poem sewn with intellect's fierce threads. Earth-bound cage, yet plucked from constellations, fell. Hollow the halls that her echo withheld. When death writes in cancerous strokes, resilience still binds the story told. We are, because she was. Full as a fallen moon, her music ended too soon.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ocean Vuong. You woke up this morning feeling nostalgic. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Christina Britzolakis obituary My wife, Christina Britzolakis, who has died aged 60 of cancer, taught English literature at the University of Warwick, where she worked from the early 1990s until ill health forced her to retire last year. A highly talented scholar, she had a fierce intelligence and love of learning that took her from a childhood in Africa to a doctorate at the University of Oxford and then on to her later teaching career.\".
