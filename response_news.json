You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"If you can\u2019t trust the voice of David Attenborough, what can you trust? It sounds too fanciful and too outrageous to be true, but nothing is too outrageous for the world the tech bros have bequeathed us. The BBC has revealed that various websites and YouTube channels are using AI to clone the voice of David Attenborough and get him to say things \u2013 about Russia, about the US election \u2013 that surely he would\".
