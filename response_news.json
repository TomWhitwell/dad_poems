{"poem": "Title: Translucent Walls of Human Law\n\nOne echoes soundlessly in Turkey's liminal space,\nFather, once familiar, entrapped in a nestled place. \nSeparation sweats its bitter salts, a desiccated face,\nLove prolongs - between two hearts, a daunting chase. \nIn official corridors, forgotten names manoeuvre maze,\nAmong the ink and seals, one plea casts its gaze.\nJudicial review, oh, silent Sphinx of our days.", "prompt": "You are the poet Sylvia Legris.
