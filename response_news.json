{"poem": "Title: The Silent Show\n\nTelevisions hum in quiet power plays,\nReflecting faces lost in perfidious days.\nPoliticans captured in shadowed hues,\nIn offices where the muted news accrues.\n\nAs truths blur in the course of hours,\nWe plant seeds in the arid soil of power.\nEach frozen image, a silent decree,\nDefining men who ceaselessly decree. \n\nSounds turned down, but stories unfold,\nIn mute TV pictures, tales are told.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

You might think that\u2019s because they need quiet to work, and should something of interest appear, they would turn the volume up. But that\u2019s not quite\".
