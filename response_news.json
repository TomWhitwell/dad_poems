You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Mumsnet calls for under-16s social media ban with cigarette-style health warnings Mumsnet has launched a campaign to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s featuring health warnings in the style of those on cigarette packets. The deliberately provocative national advertising campaign calls for all social media to be banned for children under the age of 16. The images on billboards and social media make a number of stark statements related to health. They claim that \u201cthree hours or more social media a day makes teens more likely to self-harm\u201d, that teen phone addiction doubles the risk of anxiety, that social media use can increase the risk of eating disorders in young people and that addictive social media use in teens is linked to higher risk of suicidal behaviour. The ads request that people email their MP and \u201cdemand an under-16s social media ban\u201d. Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, announced the launch of the campaign. She said: \u201cFamilies are living with the harm caused by social media every day. This isn\u2019t about parents failing to set boundaries. It\u2019s about children being exposed to products deliberately designed to be addictive. Parents are watching the consequences unfold in real time: compulsive use, lost sleep, rising anxiety and collapsing self-esteem, while the companies responsible continue to profit. \u201cThe idea that this can be fixed with better parenting or more guidance is a convenient fiction. You can\u2019t out-parent a business model built on addiction. This campaign shines a light on the damage phone addiction\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
