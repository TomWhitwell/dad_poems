It\u2019s a fairytale city, not only because of the hilltop castle that overlooks its cobbled streets and half-timbered houses, but also because this is where the Grimm brothers once lived and studied, starting the collection of folklore stories that would eventually become their famous anthology of fairytales. Throughout the city, sculptures \u2013 some&nbsp;perched in improbable places\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
