{"poem": "\"An Echo of Voices Past\"\n\nIn the austere halls of rulers,\nA whisper creeps, ancestral, reverent.\nAnishininiimowin woven into tapestry of time,\nStriking chords once thought extinct,\nPulled from the throat of a First Nation.\nLanguage, blood-borne, echoes past wrongs,\nOntario listens with all its vast expanse,\nCompelled to honour.\nSol Mamakwa speaks, the North stirs,\nHis people's voice, echoed in his heart,\nBreathes warmth into the cold present.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
