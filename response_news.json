These hands\ndug deep for tin, found only\nthe silence of ghosts.\nIn each tump, shadows linger,\nengine houses without engines,\nhistory embedded in stone,\na silent wealth that breathed\nits last.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.

On every tump stand houses for engines built to raise ore from, and drop men into, the Great Flat Lode \u2013 a rock field that coughed up 90,000 tonnes of tin, worth $3 billion at today\u2019s rates.
