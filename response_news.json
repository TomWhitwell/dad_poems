{"poem": "\"Once More in the Half-Light of Blackpool\"\n\nCome all to the coast, where the spotlight hath dimmed\nOn saucy tales cloaked in shadows, faces grinned.\nRebirth in the nightglow, seasoned with cheer,\nBlackpool, thy light, shrouds not in mockery, but veneer.\nGentle jest of a town that winks in the dark,\nYour neon mirth paints our love, bold and stark.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018It\u2019s about restoring pride\u2019: can Blackpool use its saucy image to win back the crowds? Risque jokes have long been a feature of stage shows in Blackpool, Britain\u2019s cheeky home of seaside fun. Traditionally, quite a few of these are told at the expense of the town, known for its autumn illuminations, with gentler gags noting how much better it looks in the dark. Now the London opening of Jez Butterworth\u2019s latest play, The Hills\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
