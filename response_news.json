We do so at a time when the fabric of our diverse society feels increasingly fragile. Since October the UK has witnessed unprecedented increases in anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate crimes. Much is made of the role of the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza as a driver of this hatred: British Muslims being held\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
