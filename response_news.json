{"poem": "**Cilento Morning**\n\nIn chestnut woods where cyclamen    \nand crocus catch the sun's first glance,    \nbright fungi spheres, quiet as time,    \nemerge from earth's patient palm.    \nThe air thick with myth, a lullaby of rustling leaves,    \nuntil\u2014gentle grunts, a wild boar's song    \nbreaks the forest's sacred pause,    \nnature's breathing constancy.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Hiking in southern Italy: myths, mountains and wild boar in Cilento In the silence of the chestnut woods, rays of sunlight ignite the patches of pink cyclamen and crocus. There are fungi of various kinds dotted around, including one that is a perfect sphere of bright orange pushing its way up out of earth. I sit on a rock and after a while I hear a gentle grunting noise, the sort of contented chunter made\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Hiking in southern Italy: myths, mountains and wild boar in Cilento In the silence of the chestnut woods, rays of sunlight ignite the patches of pink cyclamen and crocus.
