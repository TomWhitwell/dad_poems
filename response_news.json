{"poem": "**The Dead Bear in Central Park**\n\nOnce a cub, now a carcass laid,\nIn a garden where the concrete sighs.\nBlunt-force truths in the city's shade,\nA candidate's shadow under skies.\n\nThe heart of nature meets the soul of man,\nBoth bruised by sovereign choices made.\nIn urban woods, a silent span,\nWhere innocence was harshly weighed.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
