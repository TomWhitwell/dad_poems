{"poem": "Title: \"Blind Date Laundry\"\n\nShirt thrown forsaken in the frothy fray,\nAnona's armour post-date replay.\nHoping for laughter, bristle, and zest,\nMet by an embrace, unexpected guest.\n\nConversational twirl of children, worlds, script,\nFarsi whispers, mathematics tipped.\nSouth she pointed, missing no beat,\nNadeem stood, earnest though fleet.\n\nIn the spin cycle, memories bled,\nRinsed under humour, stories unsaid.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
