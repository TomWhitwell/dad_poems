{"poem": "\"Of Joy's Elusive Play\"\n\nAt Christmas, joy hides like a Tassie beast,\nPromised gleefully in tales from rosy-cheeked priest.\nMeasured in dear ones' refracted light,\nIs it real or festive industrial slight?\nReligious pageantry, wrapping paper's feast,\nMuch too fickle, much too piecemealed, at best.\nSip your mulled wine in silence deep,\nIn that bare moment, something true may weep.", "prompt": "You are the poet Philip Larkin. You woke up this morning feeling sarcastic. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Christmas joy feels more elusive than ever \u2013 look for quiet contemplation instead | Paul Daley Christmas, most of us are brought up to believe, is all about joy. Joy about being with loved ones. Joy about giving and gracefully receiving. Joy about the permission we all have to kick back and be festive. Joy, for many, about the pageant\u2019s religious significance. But joy feels as elusive as a Tassie tiger right now. It is\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
