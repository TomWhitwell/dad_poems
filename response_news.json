{"poem": "Title: Amid the Cocoa Veins\n\nIn December's predawn hue, we uncap the tin, journey our fingers through Quality Street. Once children, now grown, we face chocolate's lineage in Venchi's grown-up guise. Love, grasp what is given, delicately consuming the shadows of sweetness. No judgment, just a feast, fathomed and rich. The halcyon days are shimmering still, within cocoa's clandestine embrace.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ocean Vuong. You woke up this morning feeling celebratory. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Notes on chocolate: lifting the lid on Christmas selection boxes Who doesn\u2019t love dipping their hand into a tin of chocolate at this time of year? Quality Street is the favourite, but while I love the childhood idea of them, they are just not my cup of tea any more. If they are yours please enjoy them. More grownup versions exist with more grownup prices. I have a soft spot for Italian Venchi\u2019s offerings. This\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
