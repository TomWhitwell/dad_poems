{"poem": "**Echoes of Anatolia**\n\nIn the morning's quiet,  \nI read of voices strung,  \nAcross the Bosphorus \u2014  \nA lute electrified,  \nGrains of dust transformed.  \nThey sow the seeds,  \nForgetting tomorrow's fruit,  \nWhile in the west,  \nWe listen,  \nFor what is lost,  \nYet found anew;  \nTime's circle,  \nThe saz's hum  \nA timeless song.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
