{"poem": "**The Misplaced Anniversary**\n\nIn the quiet, a tale unfolds,  \nA journey of love misplaced,  \nFrom Crickhowell's embrace  \nTo Cowbridge's unknown arms\u2014  \nA digital mix, a bearer of dreams  \nGone astray upon the electric stream.  \nYet, love finds its way,  \nA path through the heart's geography.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"We wanted to stay at a Bear hotel \u2013 just not one 50 miles away For our 40th wedding anniversary we booked a night at the Bear hotel in Crickhowell, Wales, via [the booking website] Super.com. The details were duly confirmed in an email, but when I called the hotel to check about dining, it had no trace of the booking. It turned out we had been booked at the Bear hotel in Cowbridge.
