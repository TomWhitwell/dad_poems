The man whose legs were wrapped around his head was not giving up, pulling at Wang\u2019s silver-tipped hair, dyed especially for the occasion. But Wang knew what he had to do. Reaching up with one arm, he grasped his opponent\u2019s neck, and pulled forwards, flinging him\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
