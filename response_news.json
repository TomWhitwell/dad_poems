Politicians do not often show their emotion but for Stogia, who arrived in Britain as a student from Greece in 1995, this is personal. \u201cI am angry,\u201d she said of Farage\u2019s party. \u201cI am very, very angry. How dare they come here and spread this division?\u201d Her voice breaking, she added: \u201cFor them, this is a show. For me, this is my community. This is my people.\u201d Westminster byelections are often bruising affairs but the battle for Gorton and Denton is one of the most unpredictable contests, with the highest stakes, in years. Labour is fighting both Reform UK and the Green party to cling on to its 13,000-vote majority after the retirement last month of Andrew Gwynne, who stepped down after the \u201cvile\u201d Trigger Me Timbers WhatsApp scandal. Starmer\u2019s government is engulfed in crisis over Peter Mandelson\u2019s links to Jeffrey Epstein, and defeat on 26 February is likely to prompt further calls for the prime minister to quit. Labour has dominated this diverse patch of south-east Manchester for decades. But less than three weeks before polling day, the Green party is the bookies\u2019 favourite. Sheltering from a biting wind in Denton this week, Stogia accused the Greens of \u201clying\u201d to the public by printing a \u201cmisleading\u201d chart on its leaflets\".
