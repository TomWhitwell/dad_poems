{"poem": "Title: \"Silencing the Digital Babble\"\n\nIn silence, we scribe\nour world on a screen.\nEclipsing noise with swift, invisible\nkeys. No-thing against\nthe scree of unending data, \nThe tidal wave, digital spray - \nA life hack or a secular prayer?\nYet in the hushed tenderness of\nthe quiet, souls are reborn.\nMute not your neighbour;\nInstead silence thy self. Cut not the connection,\nlearn instead to listen.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Muting people on social media is fast and free and will change your life I don\u2019t generally believe in life hacks. As much as I\u2019d love to imagine that one easy tweak could resurface my life like it\u2019s a cracked tennis court, time and experience have shown me that positive change usually comes slowly and incrementally. But there is one hack I fully believe in. It\u2019s fast and free, and will instantly change your life\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Muting people on social media is fast and free and will change your life I don\u2019t generally believe in life hacks.
