{"poem": "**In Scranton's Shadow**\n\nIn Scranton's streets, the whisper  \nOf red keeps rising. Gold sneakers  \nStride past rusted mills, where dreams  \nOf blue fade, tattered, ignored.  \n  \nMerchants of belief sell tales,  \nStitched in slogans, ironed on  \nHope, bitter echoes in the halls,  \nUnseen.  \n  \nThe old coal dust settles  \nAs history spins anew.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
