{"poem": "Title: \"Quantum Compass - A Subterranean Dance\"\n\nBeneath London's tumult, Cotter encircles\nAntiquity with the new - a stainless wonder,\nCarrying rubidium atoms across the\nFamilial noise of forgotten tracks.\nHis lasers, icier than death,\nSketch out the pulses of unseen stars.\nWhere once was compass and sextant,\nIntertwine now lines of quantum dance. \nA discovery, that down in the underground,\nResides the infinite in silent, soulful sound.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

They include a stainless steel vacuum chamber, a few billion atoms of rubidium and an array of lasers that are used to cool his equipment to a temperature just above absolute zero.
