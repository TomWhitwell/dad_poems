{"poem": "**The Quarry's Hidden Nightlife**\n\nWhen dusk disguises the quarry's calm face,  \nthe hopeful creep of shadows unfurls.  \nBeneath the swimmers' absent splashes,  \nbeneath the divers' vigilant gaze,  \nthe covert crustacean ventures forth,  \nits journey unnoticed, a silent ballet  \namong the echoing remnants of boats,  \nwhere the sunken secrets whisper  \nin the language of the unseen.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Country diary: A hopeful hunt for a covert crustacean | Derek Niemann When night falls over a drowned quarry, hope crawls out of despair. The human swimmers who play by day here, sploshing back and forth under sheer limestone walls, will not see it. Teams of wetsuited divers will not either, and they have other priorities. These divers go deep, sinking 25 metres to the rock bottom, where wheelhouse wrecks of boats are metal boxes\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
