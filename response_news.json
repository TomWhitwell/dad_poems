{"poem": "Title: In Ashen Echoes\n\nCivil strife, born of nameless discord, yields\nAn apathetic landscape of shattered ideals.\nSmoky spectres rise from CGI grotesques,\nSilhouettes of power, burnt husks of progress.\nIn the distant haze, mere extras we become,\nLying strewn, lost voices with no anthem.\nA spectacle, you say? Evading politics,\nYet silent commentary burns as ghastly pyrexics. \nSomeday perhaps, the issues we'll unmask,\nTill then, we enjoy the firework's vast expanse.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
