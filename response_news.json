You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Met on Faberg\u00e9 egg hunt after items worth \u00a32m poached from Soho pub Metropolitan police officers are still trying to recover an unusual pickpocketing haul after a Faberg\u00e9 egg and watch worth \u00a32m were stolen at a pub in Soho in London. Enzo Conticello stole the treasures from Rosie Dawson, the director of premium brands at the Craft Irish Whiskey Company, in a West End pub in November 2024, alongside some more conventional loot contained in the handbag he swiped, including her laptop and credit cards. Met detectives arrested him in Belfast on 26 January. Conticello, also known as Hakim Boudjenoune, appeared at Southwark crown court on Tuesday where he admitted theft and three counts of fraud by false representation. He arrived in court wearing a grey prison tracksuit and did not enter a plea to a charge of concealing criminal property, including the egg and watch. Judge Griffith told him: \u201cIt must have been rather a surprise to you when you saw that egg. What you did with it, I don\u2019t know at the moment, but I expect we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d Conticello, who is of no fixed address and admitted to using the credit cards after stealing them, was remanded in custody and will next appear at Southwark crown court on 6 March when he is expected to be sentenced.
