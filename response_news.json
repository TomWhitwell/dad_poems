In Derbyshire, I\u2019m lucky if I encounter them half a dozen times, so to see 24 in a morning signals that this Herefordshire site is very special. There are 30&nbsp;pairs all in nest boxes and all part of a ringing project. Even more remarkable is\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
