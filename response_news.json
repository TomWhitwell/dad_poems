{"poem": "\"Resilience, Bound in Rain\"\n\nCalifornia, steeped in storm-born grief,\nHeavy curtain of rain unveiled, brief.\nShattered records; a tale of torment,\nHillsides hum an echoing lament.\n\nYet, the sun's kiss arrives, slow, tender,\nAll earthly wounds it yearns to mend,\nTeasing hope from the hardest Wednesday,\nIn each drop, sorrow's disarray ends.\n\nSo let go, feel the growth beneath, \nStrength is born from gritted teeth.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
