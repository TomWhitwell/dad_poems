{"poem": "**Discord Within**\n\nIn halls where voices falter,  \nauthority's ghost stirs,  \nechoing through drafts  \nof cold policy. Silence  \nholds its breath, tasting  \nthe currency of winter.  \nGales whisper unkept promises;  \nideals fray under harsh hands,  \nas shadows dance in mistrust's  \nflickering light.  \nWhere power once stood,  \nnow only echoing steps,  \nand a fractured hymn remains.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative.

To suspend four MPs for rebellion suggests a lack of authority and a lack of nerve, not a sense of confidence. Bullying and threats are no way to manage a party, but a signal that Labour has lost control, with its crude methods in cutting winter fuel payments and its attempt\".
