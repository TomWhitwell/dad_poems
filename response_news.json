{"poem": "\"Dewy Dawn in Mountain Skies\"\n\nPlum blossom trembles, cradled by wind,\nReflecting Sydney's eager lens.\nBeneath the shroud it's spring again,\nWith waratah and flannel friends.\nA milky way of flowers yield \nTo the coldest snows they've known.\nAnd then the air, like faith, softens,\nGifting promise in its tone. \nEach mountain snake does weave a path -\nNature's quiet symposium. Bask in the glow.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018Snakes on bush paths, pool dinners and storms \u2013 summers in the mountains are glorious\u2019 Of course it starts with spring. Sunlight slides in a sheet under the back door. In the bush there\u2019s wattle, waratah and a milky way of flannel flowers. In the garden there are blossoms: plum, apple, cherry and dogwood. The air feels softer. Sometimes, it snaps back to cold and snows, and people rush up from Sydney to take photos.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
