{"poem": "\"In Epitaph of an Unobtrusive Man\"\n\nSeventy-seven years poured,\ninto the humble vessel of Stephen Cox.\nBehind scenes, he danced,\nsoft-footed in Kensington's shade.\nDemocracy's whispering courtier,\nhistory's quiet scribe.\nHis map - a globe with emerging voices,\nHis legacy - the Royal ink of Pepys and Halley,\nIn the silent echo of his laughter,\nhe remains.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
