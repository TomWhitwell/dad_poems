{"poem": "\"Journey of Inheritance\"\n\nNo words are spoken, yet our stories interweave,\nHung on the drapes of ancestor's hands.\nA brother of power, now in mother's shadow,\nDaughter of silence, finding her stand.\nEach hallowed belonging, a quiet echo,\nAwakens echoes of family, this strife-ridden band.\nBut remember, we are swirling stardust,\nCarved in earth's memory, in this inheritance land.", "prompt": "You are the poet Joy Harjo.

But after my mother\u2019s death a few months ago (my father died many years earlier), I am having to deal with them, because we are all executors of my mother\u2019s estate. Jon managed my mother\u2019s finances\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
