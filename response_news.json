The UK has no published guidelines for how it reviews and assesses allegations that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack, unlike its closest ally, the US. The ruling was made in response to a freedom of information case brought by the conflict monitor Airwars, as part of an investigation into the UK\u2019s record in its bombing campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The US, which led the coalition of countries providing air support in the war on IS, has admitted killing more than 1,400 civilians with its strikes. Airwars had sought more information about the single civilian death acknowledged by the UK. The British government said in May 2018 that one civilian was killed by a strike that targeted three fighters in eastern Syria earlier that year, but the strike was not logged in the records of civilian casualties kept by the US-led coalition and did not appear in a UK list of attacks that killed militants. Syrian human rights groups had no record of a civilian killed in that area on that day. The judge ruled against Airwars, based on national security considerations that were presented in closed court and therefore excluded from the ruling.
