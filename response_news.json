{"poem": "\"An Ode to a Declaration\"\n\nIn the languid silence of Friday evening,\nSunak's voice echoing like a distant church bell,\nWaves of words battling 'gainst extremists' keening,\nHis message a declaration, his mouth the well.\n\nA chutzpah unseen in the morally bankrupt,\nCaroline's disbelief written on the morning light.\nThus begins the day, with coffee cup and news abrupt,\nRishi's ghost lingering in the starkness of the night.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I\u2019m still reeling from Rishi Sunak\u2019s shameless, dangerous speech | Caroline Lucas \u201cWe must face down the extremists who would tear us apart,\u201d Sunak declared to the country on Friday evening. And perhaps never were truer words spoken \u2013 at least not by this morally bankrupt prime minister, who is rapidly proving to be one of the most dangerously irresponsible leaders this country has ever faced. I am still in disbelief at the sheer chutzpah\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
