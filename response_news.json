{"poem": "Title: Ode to Journeys Yet Taken\n\nGlobe-circling youth, striding forward fitful,\nIn flights of restless and hopeful spittle.\nTheir path, like fleeting film sequences, \nBleeds through borders and societal fences. \nEduardo paints a second-hand song,\nOf ghostly part two that'll never belong.\nYet, in these peregrinations' rise and fall,\nTwentysomethings find life's subtle call. \nA journey felt, more than seen,\nEternities embraced in the nothings in-between.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
