{"poem": "\"Harvest of Eden\"\n\nIn Cleethorpes, a monstrous farm the sea cries,\nSalmon shackled in terrestrial lies.\nThe council's blinkered eyes turn away,\nA flawed decision breeds decay.\nA mute pardon, life's brutal theft,\nEach gilled heartbeat, a stolen breath.\nChallenge thee, Gove, reverse this norm,\nReturn the fish to their sea-borne form.\nNature's songs in currents dive,\nIn wild waters, let them thrive.", "prompt": "You are the poet Sylvia Plath.
