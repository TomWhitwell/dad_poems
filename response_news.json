{"poem": "\"Galician Icarus\"\n\nBeneath the dashboard of the morning sun,\nTwo sailors pause, tangled in eel lines,\nAs seagulls mock their work with lofty cries.\nTheir toil tastes of salty grit, of generations\nBaptised in the perilous poetry of the sea.\nUnnoticed, their daily bread becomes the world's feast,\nAnd in the shimmering silence, Fisterra awakes,\nSimply living what the mercurial sea allows.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018It\u2019s eating what the sea provides\u2019: Galicia\u2019s Atlantic diet eclipses Mediterranean cousin Seagulls shriek, boats bob and the morning sun silvers the waters off the Coast of Death as two sailors take a break from winding up their conger eel lines to ponder the sudden interest in precisely what, and how, people here have eaten for centuries. Like many in the small Galician fishing town of Fisterra \u2013 whose name is derived from the Latin\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
