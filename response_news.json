{"poem": "Title: \"Gloom on the Pearl\"\n\nBeneath bitter dragon's breath,\nHong Kong dreams of former swath;\nA jewel diminished in its depth,\nNo respite from Xi Jinping's wrath.\n\nGone the sway of freedom's song,\nQuiet joy withers in his winter;\nFrom the fortress where hearts belong,\nIn hushed defiance, whispers linger.\n\nSo farewell, Hong Kong's lost might,\nIn your shadow, liberty's tale still resonates;\nSunset meets the once vibrant site,\nYet its spirit, repression never abates.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Lies, ideology and repression: China seals Hong Kong\u2019s failed-state fate | Simon Tisdall So farewell, Hong Kong. The vibrant, pulsating city-state that grew, under British rule, into one of the world\u2019s great financial, business, cultural and tourism hubs has finally been brought to heel. Browbeaten, abused, silenced. Trust Xi Jinping, China\u2019s dementor president, to suck out all the joy. Last Wednesday was the UN\u2019s International Day of Happiness. But it was a sad, bad day\".
