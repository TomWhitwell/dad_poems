{"poem": "Title: Brexit Beat Bemoaning\n\nOh, Cameron, you crooning sycophant,\nBleeding platitudes through hollow smiles.\n'Heat and anger' cooled, so nonchalant,\nYet beneath the surface, discord piles.\nBrexit left us wounded, wearied,\nIn the heart of Europe, still queried.\nWindsor facade, your graceless game,\nTo the loom of uncertainty, you lay claim.\nHush, dear boys, in corridors of power,\nEchoing the clock's somber hour.", "prompt": "You are the poet Allen Ginsberg. You woke up this morning feeling melancholic. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"David Cameron says \u2018heat and anger\u2019 gone from UK-EU relationship David Cameron has said the \u201cheat and anger\u201d has gone from the UK-EU relationship, as he spoke at length about the UK\u2019s global position after Brexit for the first time since becoming foreign secretary. Cameron told peers on the Lords European affairs committee that relations between London and Brussels were better than they had been for some time, in part thanks to the Windsor framework\".
