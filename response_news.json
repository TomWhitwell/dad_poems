{"poem": "\"Brief Encounter in Alpine's Serenity\"\n\nA black silhouette breaches the sanctuary,\nWhere a boy watches videos in a cabin, awry.\nIntertwines technology and the beast ordinarily shy,\nAzimuth of safety, under an Arizona sky.\nIn the coil of events, lessons may lie,\nRemember, life is not just a passive lullaby.\nThis is the sixteenth dance of the bear and human's tie. \nBy nature's quirk or our own denial, we connect and say goodbye.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
