{"poem": "Title: Brevity of the Unseen War\n\nIn 2050's dawn, silvered in sorrow's haze,\nThe World's organs - ravaged, tell of chaos untamed.\nHealth as scattered birds, seeking sanctuary,\nFrom silent tempests within, where battle lines are unnamed.\nHear the whispered numbers, death's cold fraction,\nA prophesy of loss, in pity's subtraction.\nYet, in cancer's cruel arithmetic, find also,\nThe incalculable truth of human grit and glow.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
