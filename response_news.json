{"poem": "To Bella, Confined to a Tank\n\nThrough glass, the eyes meet,\nA mirroring of hearts,\nBella, your silent song submerged\nin unsought splendor.\n\nRound and round, in Seoul's shine,\nYou trace the edges of an ocean misplaced\u2014 \nAn opulent prison adorned in glass and steel.\n\nTime races, Bella, \nin the heart of the city's hollow,\nYet, hope pulses in your every swirl.\n\nFor in the neon and noise,\nYour call echoes\u2014 a cry of life, \nA plea for freedom.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
