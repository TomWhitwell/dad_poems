You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Waiting for Godot review \u2013 Matthew Kelly and George Costigan are a bleakly funny double act Productions of Samuel Beckett\u2019s modernist classic often evoke the world of music hall. The duelling routines of Vladimir and Estragon recall the banter of old-time vaudeville acts. A sequence of hat-swapping could have come straight from Laurel and Hardy. Echoes of that remain in Dominic Hill\u2019s staging, a co-production with the Liverpool Everyman and Bolton Octagon, but his approach is less end of the pier than end of the road. The backdrop far behind Matthew Kelly (Estragon) and George Costigan (Vladimir), who always gravitate to the front of the stage, is a lost highway, its telegraph poles fading into the distance, its material ripped and worn to reveal the walls of the theatre. Central to Jean Chan\u2019s design is a post-apocalyptic tree, charred, barren and tapering, as if pointing an accusatory finger at the heavens. At its base is the carcass of a truck that, under Lizzie Powell\u2019s lights, sometimes looks like a coffin. Even the safety curtain has a morbid air as it grinds upwards. We are at the end of history and yet life goes on. \u201cWe should turn resolutely towards nature,\u201d says Kelly, momentarily taken by the tree\u2019s single leaf. The seasonal cycle continues however threadbare the material that fills each day.
