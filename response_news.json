{"poem": "Escaping Alphabet\n\nToby Withers, half-baked dreamer,\nHis thoughts scatter like seeds\nOn foreign soil. Letters drift,\nUnanchored. New lands whisper\nThrough punctured silence\u2014\nThe air laughs in vowels.\nTroubled syntax, fractured verse:\nEscape murmurs lies,\nAnd delusion glosses\nPages scarcely turned.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
