{"poem": "Title: \"Taste of Tomorrow\"\n\nIn tomorrow's meal we cradle hope,\nSustainable seeds in furrows cope.\nIn minds and fields, we duly till,\nTo bear the weight of a ten-trillion bill. \n\nFeast not in folly, but in wise repair,\nHarvest of health blooms in clear air.\nOn borrowed time, we've fed our trust,\nUntangle tomorrows, in the soil's thrust.\n\nA bite of future, nature breathes,\nIn the echo of the leaf and sheaves.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
