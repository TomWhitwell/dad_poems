{"poem": "**Epitaph of Friendship**\n\nIn the fields of youth, a child's play,  \nHearts bruised by exclusion's silent blade.  \nAt sixty, the same wound echoes,  \nUnseen hands close the circles.  \nWisdom whispers, though love falters\u2014  \nYet time reshapes,  \nFlowers of friendship beckon,  \nRooted deep in forgiving soils.  \nNo single withered bloom defines the garden,  \nMutual hands, once more, entwine.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Should friendship really be a \u2018one strike and you\u2019re out\u2019 deal? There aren\u2019t many experiences in life that feel the same at six as they do at 60. Where, even if you\u2019ve advanced in wisdom as well as age and can intellectualise the circumstances and better disguise your pain, the raw emotion is identical. However, being left out by your friends hurts just as much when you\u2019re an adult as it did when you were\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Should friendship really be a \u2018one strike and you\u2019re out\u2019 deal?
