Angela Rayner, here is my advice | Michael Heseltine The importance of levelling up is now understood across the political spectrum, and its inclusion in the responsibilities of Angela Rayner (despite it reportedly being dropped from the department name), the new deputy prime minister, ensures that the government will be judged on its delivery. Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, is right about the lack of money.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "I\u2019ve spent a lifetime working to level up Britain.
