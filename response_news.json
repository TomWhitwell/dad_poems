{"poem": "### A Voice That Persists\n\nIn the quiet rooms where silence tries to rule,  \na voice, clear as morning light, resounds\u2014  \nNoor's call for Mahmoud, for a future  \nthat refuses to dim. Her words are seeds,  \nplanted in the earth of resolve,  \ngrowing upward,  \nreaching for the sky.  \nHer children's laughter spreads them further.  \nWe will not be silenced.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
