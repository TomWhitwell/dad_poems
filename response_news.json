{"poem": "**The Saturday Sitting**\n\nIn the echoing halls of Westminster,  \nwhere murmurs transform into mandates,  \nthey gathered beneath the somber clock,  \nforging decrees like steel.  \n  \nHere, the air was heavy with resolve,  \nas losses were stoked into flame,  \nlosing only the softness of retreat,  \nunder the weight of law's new chain.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Emergency law passed to force loss-making steel companies to keep operating Emergency legislation allowing the government to instruct companies to keep loss-making steel operations in England open, or face criminal penalties for their executives, were passed yesterday during an extraordinary sitting of parliament. MPs and peers trooped into Westminster for a rare Saturday sitting after prime minister Keir Starmer and a small team of cabinet ministers decided on Friday morning that special powers were needed\".
