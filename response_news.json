{"poem": "**Expatriate Love**\n\nIn a foreign land, love  \nwraps itself in others' dreams.  \nThe soil beneath, unfamiliar,  \nnudges roots to grow sideways,  \nseeking old whispers of home.  \nHearts navigate through alien skies,  \neach star a question,  \nasking silently, persistently:  \nDoes love wear a passport?  \nSomewhere in the distance,  \nthe familiar calls, persistent,  \nlike a forgotten song.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
