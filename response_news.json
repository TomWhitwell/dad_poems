{"poem": "Title: Macbeth's Mimicry\n\nBeehive of ambition, sphere for a sceptre,\nMacbeth's hand grasps the air where a dagger's phantom cowers, \nJuggler's ring fashioned to the helm,\nAcrobat king, regality overwhelms. \nSpotless stage, but crime veils the ether,\nInvisible ink bleeding slyly, a silent spectre. \nStock props absent, yet tragedy's tale grows stronger,\nBare of blood, yet guilt echoes longer.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Not at all. Macbeth is centre-stage and thrusting a hand towards a juggler\u2019s ring instead of a weapon. A handful of rings are then fashioned into a crown that is precariously balanced atop the acrobat\u2019s head. There are no other props, and not a damned spot of stage blood, in this uncommon\".
