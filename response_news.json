Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack.

Calocane, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before the attacks, was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in January 2024 after admitting three counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and three counts of attempted murder. A statutory inquiry will begin on Monday to assess the \u201cevents, acts and omissions\u201d before the attacks and what can be done to prevent something similar happening again.
