At a youth club in Brixton, Sadiq Khan shoots some pool with a group of teenagers. He listens to some tracks recorded in the club\u2019s small studio. He chats with them about a recent hiking trip. He recounts a visit to the countryside with his own youth club that included his first encounter with a cow.\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
