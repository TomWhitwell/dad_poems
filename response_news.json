{"poem": "**The Empty Market**\n\nBeneath the pavilion's shade,  \nthe whispers of absence linger\u2014  \nonce vibrant voices muted,  \nas horse tracks fade into dust.  \nWhere sea's wealth was sorted,  \nnow echoes of salted breezes  \ncarry the cost, unseen.  \nHands that nurtured the ocean's gift  \nare left counting shadows,  \nwhile distant tables feast  \non silent harvests.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

A few years ago, they say, the market would have been bustling with ice-cream sellers, salt vendors and horse-drawn carts delivering freshly caught fish to the women, who would set about sun-drying, salting and sorting the catch\".
