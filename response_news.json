{"poem": "Title: \"Upon Rafah's Mourning\"\n\nRafah's breath hangs heavy, weighted with sorrow.\nThe hand of humanity is idling,\nSpectating as life's candle is snuffed, \nAmidst a tempest wrought by squabbling gods.\nCourage sheds its mantle in the gaze of armoured might,\nVigilant eye scanning the martyr's horizon.\nIn Rafah's dying throes, mankind's blush is hidden;\nOur silence echoes louder than the tempest's thunder.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
