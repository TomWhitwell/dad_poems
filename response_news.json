{"poem": "Title: The Wallet's Whisper\n\nIn the pocket realm of notes and coin,\nChalmers' luck plays a jaunty tune.\nBudget surplus, a tricksy Djinn,\nMocks the workers, scrimping thin.\n\nEconomy's dance, a jester's jest,\nFor Costello, Swan, and the rest.\nFortune's wheel in ceaseless spin,\nRendering good and lucky akin.\n\nBelittle not the pay packet's song,\nIts shrinking melody tragically wrong.", "prompt": "You are the poet Carol Ann Duffy. You woke up this morning feeling nostalgic. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Jim Chalmers\u2019 lucky budget surplus is no comfort to workers whose pay is shrinking | Greg Jericho When it comes to being a treasurer, it is better to be good than lucky. Peter Costello, through no skill of his own, presided over a period where each budget update would see a better figure projected and either a smaller deficit or a bigger surplus. Wayne Swan, through no fault of his own, presided over a period\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
