{"poem": "Aghazadehs\n\nIn Tehran, the bread line learns new vocabulary: stipends, visas, dollars.  \nAt night the fathers denounce the West into microphones  \nwhile their children drift through American supermarkets,  \nchoosing cereal as if selecting a future.  \nHome is a room of broken glass.  \nAbroad, the same glass holds iced tea,  \nand no one is questioned.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Members of Iran\u2019s elite accused of hypocrisy over children\u2019s lives in west Members of Iran\u2019s ruling elite have been accused of brazen hypocrisy by allegedly using the state\u2019s wealth to help to fund their adult children\u2019s lives in the west while presiding over growing economic misery and repression at home. Opposition campaigners made the accusation against some of the clerical regime\u2019s most powerful figures as a military confrontation with the US appears increasingly likely. Donald Trump has deployed a vast armada in the Middle East and confirmed he is considering strikes. Those singled out for criticism include Ali Larijani, Iran\u2019s top national security adviser, who has a daughter living in the US and two nephews in Britain and Canada, despite having long been one of the Islamic Republic\u2019s most vocal critics of western values. Larijani \u2013 a former parliament speaker and senior Revolutionary Guard \u2013 is believed to have played a key role in the deadly crackdown against opposition protests that gripped the country in January. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is reported to have tasked him with coordinating preparations for a possible war with the US. Anger at the aghazadehs, as the scions of the elite are known, is acute after the crushing of the protests resulted in a death toll that some sources put in the tens of thousands. \u201cPeople are upset that the aghazadehs are getting dollar stipends to go to the west \u2013 the United States, Europe elsewhere \u2013 to study essentially on the state\u2019s dime,\u201d\".
