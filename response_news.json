You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Record 1,000 UK taxpayers under 30 earned more than \u00a31m last year Their generation is often derided for being work-shy, self-centred and overly sensitive. But when it comes to making money, people under 30 are proving they are something else entirely: successful. A record 1,000 taxpayers under 30 earned more than \u00a31m last year, an 11% increase on the year before, HMRC records show. In total, these earners took home more than \u00a33bn in the past year, making an average of \u00a33m each. Lubbock Fine, the accountancy firm which obtained the figures from HMRC, suggested that the surge could partly be driven by influencers\u2019 income from marketing spend on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The record increase may also be down to bigger pay deals for sports, music and media stars, as well as higher salaries in technology and financial services, the accountancy firm suggested. Under 30s now account for roughly 3% of all \u00a31m+ earners and are thought to include Erling Haaland, the 25-year-old Manchester City striker who is estimated to earn \u00a3525,000 a week (about \u00a327.3m a year) and 26-year-old Molly-Mae Hague, a former Love Island contestant and influencer who is reported to command up to \u00a360,000 per post. Overall, there are now 31,000 taxpayers who earn \u00a31m a year or more, which is only a 1% rise on the year before. This indicates the number of very high earners under 30 is increasing at a much faster pace than the number of high\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
