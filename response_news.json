{"poem": "**Pathways in Europe**\n\nA trail of ancient whispers underfoot,\nstreaking through woodland and up stone spines\nto sky-split peaks where time's an echo.\nFeet drink in the silence, each step a prayer\nwhile shadows and sunlight play\nupon the pilgrim's face.\nA glimmer of caf\u00e9, a beacon of bread and wine,\nwhere soul and body find their rest.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Share a tip on a great hike in Europe There\u2019s nothing quite like a hiking trip for clearing the mind \u2013 and getting out into nature and exploring on foot allows access to places you might miss otherwise. We\u2019d love to hear about great walks you\u2019ve taken in Europe, on coasts, over hills and mountains and through forests, plus any details of excellent pitstops you\u2019ve enjoyed en route. Tell us where you went and why\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
