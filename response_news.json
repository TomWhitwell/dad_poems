{"poem": "\"Of Labour and Victory's Echo\"\n\nThrough the grey iron morning, Labour sings,\nSwings echoing down from Wellingborough's towers.\nSix victories since the decade's end rings,\nYet quiet whispers speak of dwindling powers,\nAnd subtle currents in the public's heart.\nA battle won, but, oh, the war's not tamed,\nThe votes whisper softly of a start\nWhere ebbs the tide by which they once were famed.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Labour can celebrate byelection wins, but low turnout is cause for concern The records continue to fall for Labour. The result in the Wellingborough byelection, in which the party achieved a 28.5% swing from the Conservatives, was the biggest Labour victory over the Tories since 1994 and the second biggest since the war. Along with the victory in Kingswood, the party has now made six byelection gains since 2019 \u2013 the most it has made\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
