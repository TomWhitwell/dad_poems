You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Labour thinktank close to Morgan McSweeney \u2018paid firm to investigate journalists\u2019 A thinktank previously run by a Labour minister and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff is alleged to have paid a PR firm to investigate journalists who were looking into its funding. Labour Together, once run by Morgan McSweeney and then by Josh Simons, now a Cabinet Office minister, hired APCO Worldwide to investigate journalists from the Guardian, the Sunday Times and other outlets and to identify their sources, according to claims in the Substack publication Democracy for Sale. McSweeney left Labour Together in 2020 when he joined Keir Starmer\u2019s team. He remained close to the thinktank, which was a key ally of Starmer as he led Labour to election victory in 2024. Simons was director of Labour Together when APCO was reportedly hired. Sources close to McSweeney said he had not taken the decision to hire APCO and it was a matter for Labour Together. The Guardian has approached Simons, Labour Together, the Labour party and APCO for comment. Democracy for Sale reported that Simons, McSweeney, Labour Together, the Labour party and APCO all declined to comment on the record. The allegations come as McSweeney faces severe pressure over his role in Downing Street in the aftermath of new disclosures about Peter Mandelson in the Epstein files. Downing Street has rejected calls for his removal, but Labour backbenchers say his role in Mandelson\u2019s appointment as US ambassador makes his position as the prime minister\u2019s most senior aide untenable.\".
