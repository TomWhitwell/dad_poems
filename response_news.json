{"poem": "\"An Ode to the Honoured Crumpet\"\n\nLike short stacks of sunshine in neat rows,\nthe humble crumpets call, unassuming.\nIn every airy hole, mysterious potential grows,\nof globules of butter, melting, perfuming.\nBought in sixes, they are but mimicry,\nOnly the homespun ones truly know.\nTo be smothered in love's ritual, a delicacy,\nBrings joy beyond what plastic-wrapped doppelg\u00e4ngers can bestow.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"How to make crumpets \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake's Masterclass I cannot tell you how much I love crumpets. The very word brings me joy \u2013 though not, it must be confessed, as much as the real, butter-laden deal. You can, of course, buy them in plastic-wrapped packs of six, but they never taste quite as good as the homemade sort, and this reworked recipe is perhaps my proudest achievement to date.
