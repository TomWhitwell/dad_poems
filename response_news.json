{"poem": "Title: An Ode to Peggy Guggenheim in Venice\n\nA shy Hampshire mirror stared back at Peggy,\nthen, refracted in Canal's fluid prism, her kaleidoscope soul emerged.\nHer universe concealed within the gargantuan lenses,\nand in the warmth of terriers holding the world at bay.\nVenetian palazzo walls whispered her name,\nToday, they echo her untold story,\nIn this painted life, Peggy found more than a palazzo - she found herself.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

In the painting, Peggy wears a pair of her signature outsize sunglasses, and clutches three of her beloved Lhasa Apsos terriers. Today, Peggy\u2019s palazzo\".
