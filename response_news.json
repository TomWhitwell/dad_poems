{"poem": "### National Beer Day\n\nRaise your glass on this unsentimental day,  \nbrewed from petals that never wither,  \nserved in the vessel of everyday.  \nA toast to love without an occasion,  \nwhere hops dance unfettered,  \nand bubbles speak in the language of rain.  \nHere's to the unspoken vows  \nheld beneath a foam-topped sky.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Raise a glass to National Beer Day: tips on the perfect pint I didn\u2019t write a Valentine\u2019s Day column, I also didn\u2019t do one for Mother\u2019s Day, and I won\u2019t be doing one for Father\u2019s Day, either. Who am I to tell you how to enjoy your time with your most beloved \u2013 and who am I to tell you what they ought to be drinking, seeing as these days that\u2019s invariably informed by gendered\".
