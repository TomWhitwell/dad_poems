You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Yes, Keir Starmer is Britain\u2019s most unpopular PM ever. That could liberate him | Polly Toynbee What hell is the life of politics. Look around that cabinet table: each person is confronted with near impossible-portfolios without the means to do what they know is needed. After another nightmare week, many in the dark watches must ask themselves why the hell they gave their lives to this brutally thankless task. Their inheritance was even more ruinous\".
