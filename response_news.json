You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Fairphone 6 review: cheaper, repairable and longer-lasting Android The Dutch ethical smartphone brand Fairphone is back with its six-generation Android, aiming to make its repairable phone more modern, modular, affordable and desirable, with screw-in accessories and a user-replaceable battery. The Fairphone 6 costs \u00a3499 (\u20ac599), making it cheaper than previous models and pitting it squarely against budget champs such as the Google Pixel 9a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade. The new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don\u2019t drop it in a bath or swimming pool. The back plate is held in place by two exposed Torx screws and hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed. The power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots\".
