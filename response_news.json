Its list of resident species increased by one this year when the gatekeeper, never officially recorded north of the border in the past century, was spotted in several locations. Meanwhile, the elusive white-letter hairstreak, which was only recorded for the first time\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
