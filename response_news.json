{"poem": "Title: \"In Opioid's Shadow\"\n\nThe numbers fall, they say, a minor feat,\nin halls of printed sorrow's summer heat.\nA glimmer dances, hopeful in our sight,\nyet still eclipsed by fentanyl's fierce might.\nGhostly visitors across America's bright stage,\nbuild their castles of sand and synthetic rage.\nBut in the ebb, a silent whisper grows,\nA Morse of hope, in a sea of unending woes.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
