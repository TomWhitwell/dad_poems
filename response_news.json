{"poem": "Title: Drawing Lines on Sand\n\nNetanyahu's breath laces order of clash,\nFor Rafah, city bearing the burden of displacement.\nEchoes tremble across the globe in flash,\nWorrisome whispers of further disengagement.\n\nYet, in the predictability of chaos,\nAkin to forces meeting with brutish power,\nChildren of the same Mother turn foes,\nBeneath the shadow of a looming tower.\n\nA bitter requiem, Gaza's crisis,\nHumanity's frailty laid bare, no disguises.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Netanyahu approves plans for Rafah attack, Israeli officials say Benjamin Netanyahu has approved plans for an attack on Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza where more than a million people displaced from elsewhere in the territory have sought shelter, officials in Israel have said. The decision will provoke deep concern around the world. Any attack on the city is likely to cause significant civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across the territory.\".
