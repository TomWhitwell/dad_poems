{"poem": "\"Ballad of the Stranded\"\n\nOn Bristol's sodden shores I found,\nAn itinerary rent, and hope unbound,\nRush of rain replaced the rail,\nIn privatisation's sorry tale.\n\nMonopoly of mother nature, fierce,\nYet man's creation augments the fears,\nRefracts our faults through shards of frost,\nIn journeys embarked, and tempers lost.\n\nThough suffering in the dampened day,\nA poet's dreams do not decay.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Broken-rail Britain: my journey to the heart of the nation\u2019s privatisation nightmare | George Monbiot The weather was worse than forecast. By the time I reached Bristol, at 5pm, all trains to the south-west had been cancelled, because of rising flood waters. It was no one\u2019s fault \u2013 just one of life\u2019s vicissitudes. What happened next was a different matter. I believe I\u2019m still suffering the effects of it: I think privatisation has made me\".
