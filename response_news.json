{"poem": "**At the Edge of Power**\n\nIn Caracas streets, shadows shift,\nHope, a flicker in the eyes of the weary;\nMaduro stands, the weight of a ghost.\n\nCapriles whispers of change,\nYet the air is thick, unmoving.\nWhat next, for a land paused\nBetween despair and the ember of dreams?", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

It was election night in Venezuela in 2013, and among the Chavista activists at the Caracas city hall, nerves were jangling as early results showed their candidate, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, trailing his charismatic rival for the presidency, Henrique Capriles. \u201cWe were totally surprised. We never thought Capriles would come so close,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Izarra, a former minister for Maduro\u2019s recently deceased mentor, Hugo\".
