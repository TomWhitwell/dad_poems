You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Is it true that \u2026 hair grows faster when you cut it? \u2018That\u2019s not true,\u201d says Desmond Tobin, professor of dermatological science at University College Dublin. Hair grows from follicles \u2013 tiny structures in the scalp sitting 2-4mm beneath the skin. Inside each follicle, the hair fibre is formed long before it&nbsp;becomes visible at the surface of the&nbsp;scalp. By the time it emerges, the&nbsp;hair that&nbsp;you\u2019re cutting is dead, hardened&nbsp;tissue. \u201cCutting what\u2019s above the surface has no effect on what\u2019s happening in the follicle below,\u201d says Tobin. Hair growth happens at a rate of&nbsp;around 1cm a month during a&nbsp;growth phase that lasts several years, before the hair is shed and the&nbsp;cycle begins again. That rate is&nbsp;determined by genetics and can\u2019t be&nbsp;sped up with scissors. What does change is how long hair appears to grow. Heat styling and aggressive chemical treatments can damage the outer shaft, making it brittle and prone to splitting. When hair breaks faster than it grows, it never seems to get any longer. Related: Is it true that \u2026 you lose most body heat from your head? So where does the myth come from?&nbsp;Think of trimming an unruly hedge, Tobin says. \u201cWhen you give&nbsp;it&nbsp;a&nbsp;good clip into shape, it can&nbsp;give the&nbsp;impression of being denser. You&nbsp;haven\u2019t changed what\u2019s&nbsp;happening in&nbsp;its deeper branches \u2013 you\u2019ve just tightened up the overall appearance.\u201d Hair behaves in much the same way. Individual strands taper as they&nbsp;get further from the scalp, so cutting them shorter makes them feel&nbsp;thicker. Removing frayed, weathered ends can also make hair\".
