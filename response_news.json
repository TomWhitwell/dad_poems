{"poem": "\"An Echo Lost in Careless Arms\"\n\nIn the quiet nursery, a small flame extinguished,\nwrapped in linen, cradled in hollow canvas.\nGenevieve, little-crowned darling - silenced.\nHer protestations bounced off walls, returned unheard, useless.\nA cruelty, veiled beneath the hands of innocence,\nsuffocates the tender bud - thus blooms negligence.\nStricken cries, ignored; yet, in each heart, rings unending,\nIn memory of Gigi, and a life too swiftly ending.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
