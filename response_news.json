{"poem": "\"Volunteering at Summer's Troubadour\"\n\nBeneath summer's bounty, populous tents rise,\nBartered work for passage, mirth in disguise.\nEarn your keep, steward in reveler's guise,\nFree the music, let kindness arise. \n\nBreaking barrier of commerce, a fellowship grows,\nIn Oxfam's shadow, generosity sows.\nA food token, given without throes,\nFeeding the soul as the festival glows.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
