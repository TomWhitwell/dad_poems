{"poem": "Title: In The Shadow of Lincoln\n\nHardened soul, of granite and ink,\nFrom the depths of history springs;\nA man tempered by blood and clink,\nCarves futures on freedom's wings.\nTwisted threads of tales intertwine,\nCircling 'round a ghost's fireplace.\nThrough Holzer's pen, Lincoln may shine,\nIlluminating the human race.\nIn the crucible of their shared past,\nThe echo of a New World sings.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
