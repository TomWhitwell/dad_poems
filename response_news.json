{"poem": "\"Of Giants and Shadows\"\n\nIn granite towers, a governor speaks,\nWords falling softly, yet stark,\nClaiming knowledge of the Bronx's young hearts,\nTales woven from presumptive dark.\n\nSilhouettes in the cement-cloaked garden,\nFlicker, bearing hidden might,\nIn them, the word 'computer' lives,\nSeared in by the city's light.\n\n'Tis not given to Gods alone,\nTo define the scope of a child's fight.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
