{"poem": "**Storm Darragh**\n\nThe wind, a fierce preacher,   \ntugs at the cloaks of trees,  \ncasting sermons in chaos,  \npraying in whispers  \nand roars of loss.   \nTracks lie silent,  \na nation's breath held,   \nas the sky's wild psalm   \nraises its voice,  \nleaving the land bereft,  \na hymn unsung  \nby the muted power lines,   \nprayer wheels stilled.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
