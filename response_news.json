{"poem": "Title: Decades of Thirst\n\nWithin the citadel of angst,   \nLifted by liquid sun, we danced.  \nPalms kissed in neon, we blossomed bright  \nFuelled by the acid juice of night.  \nYet ache anchored in our laughter's tide,  \nA self-hatred, no Hooch could hide.  \nFermented years, a bitter brew;  \nNow sobered, self reclaimed anew,  \nWe wake to robust dawn, and see  \nTrauma's sculptor shaped this tree.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I spent 22 years as a problem drinker. Here are 10 things I\u2019ve learned since I quit The first alcoholic drink I had was a lemon Hooch in a gay club called the Palm Beach in south London in 1991. For the first time in my life the anxiety and self-consciousness I thought was just my personality melted away. A decades-long whirlwind of partying, hangovers and self-destructive behaviour ensued, all fuelled by trauma and self-loathing.\".
