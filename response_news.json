You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Thursday briefing: Thirty years of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction \u2013 have male novelists been edged out? Good morning, and happy new year! While there are many exciting celebrations in 2026, for me, none is more special than the 30th anniversary of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. Formerly the Orange, and then Baileys prize, this annual award for the best novel in English by a woman was founded in 1996 to rectify a glaring absence: the all-male 1991 Booker prize shortlist. Times have thankfully changed. The Booker hasn\u2019t seen an all-male shortlist in 20 years, while sensations like Sally Rooney and Elena Ferrante have paved the way for stories centering the complexities of women\u2019s lives. Today, heavyweights like Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith, Hilary Mantel, and Bernardine Evaristo share the spotlight with zeitgeist-capturing talents like Ottessa Moshfegh, Elif Batuman, Raven Leilani, and Megan Nolan. Together, they have ensured some of fiction\u2019s most exciting developments are distinctly female-led. Yet, this success has sparked a heated debate: is the male novelist being pushed out? When David Szalay won the Booker last year for his novel Flesh, this newspaper noted that novels of \u201cfemale interiority\u201d have dominated the past decade, making stories about young men hard to find. But is that true? And what seismic changes have there been between now and when the Women\u2019s prize was founded? Today, I speak to Catherine Taylor, a critic who has worked in the industry since 1992 and author of The Stirrings: A Memoir in Northern Time.\".
