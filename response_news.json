{"poem": "**Heat Pump Blues**\n\nFrost fingers tap at windowpane's chill,  \nPower's out, shivering in electric silence,  \nA heat pump's promise falls bitter and still,  \nPlumbers shrug in cold defiance.  \nWhat wood won't do to tame these icy tears,  \nWarmed voices sing to furniture pyres,  \nWinter's breath, a howling choir,  \nLogbooks doomed to fiery postscript.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"How to make the heat-pump transition take off | Letters I have a heat pump (Letters, 5 January). It\u2019s not much use to me today as the electricity is out because of the bad weather, my house is beyond cold and what I\u2019d give for a fire \u2013 at least I&nbsp;could burn furniture to keep my family warm! Our heat pump has broken down on several occasions and no local plumber can deal with it\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
