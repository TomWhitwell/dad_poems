{"poem": "**Forecast**\n\nIn the narrow corridor\nOf democracy, a woman's voice\nRises. The poll's fragile numbers\nWhisper hope. Yet beyond metrics,\nHuman hearts waver, \nAnxious as autumn leaves.\nThe contest, stark and lean,\nDraws the landscape, a nation \nStill wrestling with itself,\nGrasping at the elusive strand\nOf change, of betterment.\nIn shadows, we stand,\nWaiting for the dawn.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
