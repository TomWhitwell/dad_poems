Now, a combination of new techniques, government support and the pressing need to secure continuous clean power in an era of climate crisis means that geothermal energy is finally having its moment in the US. Until recently, geothermal has only been viable\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
