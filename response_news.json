{"poem": "\"Echoes from the Continent\"\n\nSteeled hearts relent, borders melt,\nSee younglings wander, free in field and fens.\nAcross the roughened seas, once felt,\nNegotiations stir, new hope ascends.\n\nYet in silent corners of frost-kissed Albion,\nThe soil remembers, an age-old jinx.\nIn groaned words, the maddened sermon,\n'Beware the echo from Brussels', it hints.\n\nOur land sits solitary, aloof,\nWith or without the EU's youth.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Brussels proposes return to pre-Brexit mobility for UK and EU young people The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of 18- to 30-year-olds in a major concession. It said it would now seek approval from individual EU leaders to start the talks, which could partly eliminate one of the most controversial elements of Brexit, a block on the right to live in one another\u2019s\".
