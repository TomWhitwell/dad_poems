{"poem": "Title: In the Halls of History\n\nFrom Berlin's wall, fell history's sleep,\nA decade cloaked in saturnine silence,\nSwords to ploughs, relief reaped,\nYet cost of security hints violence.\nAffluence graced, star-kissed peace,\nWestward turns, yet finds no release,\nA holiday, or history's deceit?\nThe truth lies beneath Starmer's feet.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Keir Starmer needs to have a frank conversation with voters about the price of security | Andrew Rawnsley I\u2019m not certain who minted the phrase, but it is an excellent one to describe the decade or so that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent implosion of the Soviet Union. The affluent liberal democracies were treated to \u201ca holiday from history\u201d. The west started turning its Cold War swords into ploughshares once\".
