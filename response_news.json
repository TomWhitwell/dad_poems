Kuciak had been investigating alleged corruption by people connected to Slovakia\u2019s government, and his death cast a harsh spotlight on reports of links between organised crime and high-ranking Slovakian officials. Nearly six years later, following elections in September, Fico is back in power\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
