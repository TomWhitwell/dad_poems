{"poem": "\"Earthslinging Sonic Forays\"\n\nOnce upon a clan in Wu-Tang, \nStanzas spun on vinyl, sang.\nArtistry, benign and brave,\nAll caught in the lick of a soundwave.\n\nLifelong ties to verses rich,\nGrim or gay, they bewitch.\nI'm a willing wordless captive,\nTill 2103, my narrative.\n\nWho can foresee who'll recount,\nWhen my bones lay, time sans amount.\nDoes rhythm beat in dust and rain?\nWill 'Shaolin' echo on the astral plane?", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I just listened to Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. As music, it\u2019s good. As art, it\u2019s truly great This waiver I\u2019m signing says it is binding until the day I die or the year 2103 \u2013 whichever comes first. I\u2019ll be 112 years old in 2103 or (more likely) very dead. Who knows if anyone will still be talking about Wu-Tang Clan then, or what state Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\".
