{"poem": "**The Tariff Shadows**\n\nTwo giants, estranged,  \ncaught in commerce's cruel snare.  \nTariffs rise like walls,  \na sky-high blockade  \nof iron currency.  \nThe stillness, uneasy\u2014  \nechoes of war in silent markets,  \nwhere dreams of plenty  \nwither in sunless stalls.  \nTrade winds stilled,  \nwhile economies ache  \nbeneath the weight  \nof their own ambitions.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Sky-high US-China tariffs are a mutual trade embargo that will hurt both sides Sky-high tariffs that now hang heavily over US-China trade mean, effectively, that they have declared a trade embargo on each other, normally an act of war. The economic consequences for both will hurt. The US\u2019s $150bn (\u00a3113bn) or so of exports to China will fall away quickly, while China\u2019s $440bn worth of exports to the US may drop by up to 75%\".
