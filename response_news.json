You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"NHS to trial potentially life-saving treatment for deadly liver disease The NHS is to trial a potentially life-saving new treatment for a deadly liver disease that causes the body\u2019s vital organs to fail. Thirteen major hospitals will use a device that cleans patients\u2019 blood that has become corrupted by toxins as a result of them developing acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a severe and hard-to-treat form of liver disease linked to obesity, alcohol and hepatitis, in which patients suddenly deteriorate and have to be admitted to intensive care. Three out of four people affected are only diagnosed when it has already become life-threatening. Seven out of 10 people with the disease die within 28 days and only a handful of those affected are eligible for a liver transplant, which is the only existing way to reverse ACLF. Seventy-two seriously ill patients will take part in the randomised controlled trial of a machine called Dialive, starting early next year. Doctors involved say that it \u201coffers new hope\u201d and could reduce the condition\u2019s high death rate. If it proves successful, it could become the first form of liver dialysis in global medicine. Dialive seeks to aid recovery by removing dysfunctional albumin \u2013 a protein produced by the liver \u2013 and replacing it with clean, functional albumin. The \u201cintensive care liver support system\u201d works in a similar way to what happens during haemodialysis, a long-established treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working properly.
