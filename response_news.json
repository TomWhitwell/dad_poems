The fossil is embedded in a limestone wall on Plantation Lane, sitting alongside the remnants of ancient nautiloids and squid-like belemnites. It\u2019s a mineralised aquarium hiding in plain sight, a snapshot of deep time that few even glance at, a transtemporal space where patatas bravas meet prehistoric cephalopods. How often do you give thought to the stones that make up our towns and cities? To the building blocks, paving slabs and machine-cut masonry that backdrop our lives? If your name\u2019s Dr Ruth Siddall, the answer to that question would be yesterday, today and every day for the foreseeable.

It was once a prehistoric riverbed \u2013 you can still see the ripples in the surface \u2013 although to picture the world back then you need to imagine Sheffield looking like the Brahmaputra [river, which spans China, India and Bangladesh].\u201d For Ruth, the city\u2019s\".
