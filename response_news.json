Instead, it is paralysed | John Kampfner Germany, more than any other country, is struggling to disentangle the horrors of the 7 October Hamas massacre in Israel, the subsequent death of more than 30,000 Palestinians and the demolition of Gaza, and the killing of aid workers, from the scale of the Holocaust more than eight decades earlier. History has come back to haunt Germany\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
