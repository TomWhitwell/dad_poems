{"poem": "\"Pernicious Hearth\"\n\nIn the glow of warming flame,\nAn unseen serpent hisses,\nPoisoning air with breath of blame,\nMocking domestic blisses. \n\nThe poor, the brown bear burden more,\nFor progress, blind and heartless,\nWhere rich men's comfort, opulence's whore,\nFeeds a world grown dark and breathless. \n\nHeralded by chromed god, NO2,\nPays its fine in human breath,\nYet who will stem such darkened dew,\nUntil it whispers death?", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

The report, published Friday in Science Advances, found that people of color and low-income residents in the US were disproportionately affected. Indoor gas and propane appliances raise average concentrations of the harmful pollutant, also known as NO2, to 75% of the World Health Organization\u2019s standard\".
