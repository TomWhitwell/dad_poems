{"poem": "Title: \"Awaiting Aurora\"\n\nTonight I'll swap my sheets for a shroud of sky,\nEmbrace the northern chills for their ephemeral glow.\nThe celestial polar bear has stolen sunlight and,\nIn her luminescent dance across the heavens,\nShe paints our dreams with forget-me-not hues.\nFor those who missed the first act, \nAn encore will grace our darkness with wonder.\nSilent, yet profound, her ballet illuminates our insignificance.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

The northern lights might be visible in parts of the UK again on Saturday after the rare phenomenon was spotted across the country overnight. An \u201cextreme\u201d geomagnetic storm caused the lights, also known as aurora borealis, to be more visible on Friday evening \u2013 delighting millions of people across the northern hemisphere. And for those who missed out, a second chance could arise. Chris\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
