{"poem": "\"In Old Age, A Dance\"\n\nThey step like ghosts through the echo of music,\nOlder bodies, synonyms for time's cruel theatre,\nHosts of past caught in the act of life.\nTheir youth now a memory in a dance,\nGone, etched among lines of age and wisdom.\nSadler's Wells, Elixir's waters, what perceptions of age\nAre altered in the grand play of tyreless ballet?", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

That ever-blurry line is especially evident when watching older people dancing: they may lack the blithe suppleness and stamina common among younger dancers, yet their presence comes freighted with the past, their lived history. Sadler\u2019s Wells Elixir festival is all about perceptions of dance and age, and its opening\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
