You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Forget new year gardening resolutions. In 2026 I\u2019m lowering my standards Every January, I gripe about the tyranny of setting any kind of resolution while we\u2019re in&nbsp;the depth of winter. Short gloomy days and long drawn-out nights are a truly uninspiring backdrop for resolving to make meaningful changes in your life. I\u2019d love to meet whoever came up with the idea of new year resolutions and give them a piece of my mind. So I want to try something else this January. I want to make a list of things I\u2019m giving up. Not the punishing kind of giving up. I\u2019m not planning to give up any of the delicious things that I\u2019ve&nbsp;happily overeaten these last few weeks. Instead, I\u2019m going to give up doing the things that make me \u2013 and more specifically, my veg patch \u2013 feel less than good enough. First I\u2019m giving up growing winter squash. Now I love this vegetable. I&nbsp;like to cook and eat them, and I\u2019ve enjoyed growing them in the market gardens and farms I\u2019ve worked on over the years. But in my tiny patch, they never seem to thrive. It\u2019s entirely my fault, of&nbsp;course, as I\u2019m trying to grow them cheek-to-cheek with too many other plants. They need space to thrive, and I can\u2019t give it to them, so&nbsp;I\u2019m going to get ahead of this season\u2019s frustration and give up on this lovely but elusive crop for now. I\u2019m going to give up planting with a strict plan and impulse-buying more\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
