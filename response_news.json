{"poem": "**Speak Softly, Kindness**\n\nIn the dance of words and silence,  \ntimid threads weave through the air,  \nstrung between moments of care and  \nself-doubt. Compliments like wildflowers  \npicked, offered to strangers, burst  \ninto self-discovery \u2014   \na quiet revolution in the heart,  \nwhere courage draws breath  \nfrom the small works of kindness.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"The one change that worked: I felt self-conscious \u2013 until I started complimenting strangers I\u2019m an ambivert. No, it\u2019s not some made-up personality type. I enjoy spending time with others and socialising, but I need time alone to recharge. Starting conversations and keeping them flowing smoothly have never come naturally to me. I overthink everything: \u201cAm I speaking too much? I haven\u2019t said anything in the past five minutes. Quick, say something. Oh no, I\u2019ve\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "The one change that worked: I felt self-conscious \u2013 until I started complimenting strangers I\u2019m an ambivert.
