{"poem": "\"Ode to the Silent Grove\"\n\nNo bird's note sings at the dawn,\nthe creek's water has withdrawn. \nThe maple stands with borrowed time,\nin the absence of nature's chime.\nQuiet now the loamy land,\nbereft of the minstral's band. \nMan's echo loud in the hollow air,\na requiem of despair. \nA plea to heed, let the world unfold,\nlest we inherit the silence we've sold.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"No birdsong, no water in the creek, no beating wings: how a haven for nature fell silent The tale starts 30 years ago, when Bernie Krause made his first audio clip in Sugarloaf Ridge state park, 20 minutes\u2019 drive from his house near San Francisco. He chose a spot near an old bigleaf maple. Many people loved this place: there was a creek and a scattering of picnic benches nearby. As a soundscape recordist, Krause\".
