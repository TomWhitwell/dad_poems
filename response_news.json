The methodThis trick works best for small pots and moisture-sensitive plants such as orchids. But most tropical houseplants dislike cold. Their roots evolved for warmth, and icy water can shock or damage them. Room temperature plays a big role in how effective this method is: in a warm room, the ice will melt almost instantly, offering little benefit, while in a cool space it may linger too long, chilling the roots and slowing absorption. Always ensure ice cubes are made from fresh, clean water and never press them directly against stems or roots.
