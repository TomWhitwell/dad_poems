Grief-porn, in relation to cinema, would suggest that the film in question is emotionally manipulative, formulaic; grief-art would suggest the film unleashes feelings both universal and true. It\u2019s curiously circular. In a film about grief, the valorised quality is depth of feeling; it stands or falls by how profoundly the hero(ine) experiences emotion, and the audience proves its acuity, buys itself into the imaginative contract, by its ability to mirror that profundity. You only get to decide whether it\u2019s art if you\u2019re already feeling it so deeply that it must be, in other words. If the death left you cold and you found the ensuing emotionality manipulative and domineering, this logic is quite annoying. I\u2019m talking in the first instance, of course, about Hamnet, the dramatisation of Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s 2020 novel. On paper, it must be art: Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal are more than brilliant, they both have qualities of magnetism and believability that are always evident; they probably couldn\u2019t switch those off if they tried.
