{"poem": "\"Morning Musings Over Davos Headlines\"\n\nTalks of climate and chaos over breakfast eggs,\nIn a shroud of morning silence heavy as champagne.\nLimos lined up like polished silverware,\nWhile up above, Alpine snow whispers of war.\nThe shops turned temporary tech titans' lairs,\nIn the ghostly shadow of Mann's Magic Mountain.\nEach Davos dawn laced with global gloom,\nAnd yet, the world keeps spinning, room to room.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Climate, chaos and war fill a doomy agenda at Davos The limos have been booked. Hotels have loaded up with champagne. Shops have been converted into pop-up offices for the tech giants. The annual Davos talkfest is about to begin. The collective mood of the 2,800 participants is anything but cheery as they make their way to the small Alpine town immortalised by Thomas Mann in his novel The Magic Mountain for the annual meeting\".
