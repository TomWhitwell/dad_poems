You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018Are you willing to fight back?\u2019: Democrats ready to take on party\u2019s old guard ahead of midterms They are impatient, unafraid and hungry for change. Inspired by Zohran Mamdani\u2019s shock victory in last year\u2019s New York mayoral race, a wave of insurgents is mounting primary challenges against Democratic incumbents ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. The emboldened lineup of primary challengers \u2013 often, but not always, from the party\u2019s progressive wing \u2013 has been fuelled by anger over the party\u2019s tepid response to Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarianism, complicity in the war in Gaza and a crushing affordability crisis. It has left entrenched Democrats, who for years were able to cruise in safe seats in the House of Representatives, reportedly panicking that they could be swept aside in an anti-establishment revolt reminiscent of the tea party that rocked the Republican party in the 2010 midterms. The simmering discontent was evident last week in a focus group conducted by the New York Times newspaper in which rank-and-file Democrats described their own party as \u201cspineless\u201d, \u201ccomplacent\u201d, \u201cparalyzed\u201d, \u201cafraid\u201d, \u201cincompetent\u201d, \u201csuffocated, or given up\u201d, \u201csold out\u201d, \u201csellouts and suckers\u201d and \u201cno balls\u201d. Ezra Levin, co-founder of the grassroots movement Indivisible, commented: \u201cThe size of this year\u2019s primary engagement is indicative of the chasm between rank-and-file Democrats and the Democratic leadership right now. People want a different version of the Democratic party from what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Last year Indivisible channeled the backlash against Trump into \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests.
