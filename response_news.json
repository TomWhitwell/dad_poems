You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Post your questions for the Cardigans\u2019 Nina Persson After more than 30 years of melodious guitar pop, the Cardigans are returning to the stage \u2013 and their frontwoman Nina Persson will be joining us to answer your questions. The Swedish band instantly marked themselves out from the rest of both pop and alternative music when they broke through in 1995 with their album Life: sophisticated lounge-pop informed by bossa nova and disco (including sprightly Black Sabbath cover versions) was the very opposite of boorish Britpop or rave culture, and Persson\u2019s vocals \u2013 girlish yet faintly careworn \u2013 carried so much drama within them. Third album First Band on the Moon contained their first true hit, Lovefool, which reached No 2 in the UK after framing Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes\u2019 romance as Romeo and Juliet in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 film adaptation \u2013 and has endured, now closing in on its billionth play on Spotify. Their next album, 1998\u2019s Gran Turismo, was just as sophisticated but switched into a darker-hued digital palette, as on singles My Favourite Game and Erase/Rewind. Shortly after, Persson duetted with Tom Jones on a cover of Talking Heads\u2019 Burning Down the House, which was included on his mega-selling Reload album. Then there was another tonal switch, to lamplit folk-rock and brawny Americana on 2003\u2019s Long Gone Before Daylight; and another on 2005\u2019s Super Extra Gravity, full of bright pop-rock. There hasn\u2019t been another Cardigans album since, and Persson has ruled out the possibility after the departure\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
