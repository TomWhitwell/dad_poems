{"poem": "**Altadena Remembers**\n\nThe brush of memory,  \nfinds Altadena in its sunlit days,  \nwhere a diner hums,  \nand bunnies leap in ceramic chorus.  \nNow, watercolor whispers of ash,  \nframing loss in tender gray.  \nYet, in each delicate stroke,  \na legacy carved,  \nthat fire cannot erase.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Wildfire destroyed a historically Black town. These artists won\u2019t let its legacy disappear On the walls of the gallery, Keni \u201cArts\u201d Davis\u2019s watercolors show Altadena before and after the fires. There is a local hardware store, a beloved diner, the quirky local Bunny Museum, which held tens of thousands of rabbit-related items. Then, in gentle strokes of paint, there is the wreckage of each place: rubble, charred beams, burnt-out cars. Davis labels each of these\".
