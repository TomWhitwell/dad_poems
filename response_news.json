{"poem": "**The Wit of Tongues**\n\nSarcasm, a snake with a smirk,  \nits fangs clad in irony's silver.  \nA bitter sweetness lingers,  \nas sharp as a sideways glance,  \nwhile banter blooms in gentler gardens,  \nsprouting from laughter's softer soil.  \nLowest form? A jesting jest,  \nwhere words play tag  \nand leave the heart unscathed.  \nWit weaves whispers,  \nechoes that refuse to bite.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
