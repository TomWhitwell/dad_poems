{"poem": "**Altadena, After**\n\nA year on, the wind still blows indoors.  \nChar in the skirting, lead in the lullaby,  \nasbestos in the soft furnishings of sleep.  \nThey hose the drive, repaint the porch,  \nbut ash keeps its own address\u2014  \nin soil, in sockets, in lungs.  \n\"Safe?\" is a question with no spare room.  \nWe have nowhere else to go.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Construction on new properties is under way, and families whose homes survived the fire have begun to return. But many are grappling with an urgent question: is it safe to be here? The fire upended life in this part of Los Angeles county. By the time firefighters brought it under control, 19 people were dead, tens of thousands displaced and nearly 9,500 structures destroyed, primarily in Altadena but also in Pasadena and Sierra Madre. The flames incinerated many older homes and businesses filled with lead paint and asbestos. They showered the community with toxins, leaving tall piles of ash and unseen traces of heavy metals in the soil and along and inside standing structures. Research has indicated some hazards remain even after properties have undergone remediation, the clean-up process that is supposed to restore homes and ensure they are safe to occupy. As Altadena fights to return, residents \u2013 some eager to stay in the community and others who simply can\u2019t afford to go anywhere else \u2013 are facing immense challenges while trying to rebuild their lives and come back home.
