You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Will Great Britain\u2019s offshore wind subsidy auction mean lower energy bills? Great Britain has secured enough new offshore wind to power 12m homes after the most competitive \u2013 and financially generous \u2013 subsidy auction on record. The competition to secure renewable energy support contracts was considered a crucial test of the government\u2019s pro-growth agenda and its ambition to achieve a clean power system by 2030. In response, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said the \u201chistoric auction\u201d had proved the government\u2019s doubters wrong. The biggest single procurement of offshore wind in the UK and mainland Europe would now bring forward investment of \u00a322bn into the sector and create 7,000 new jobs, he said. Here we look at how the renewable energy auction promises to help the British government meet its clean energy targets. What is a renewables subsidy auction? The UK pioneered the \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d scheme, which supports new renewable electricity projects via a \u201creverse auction\u201d in which the lowest bids win. This helps to incentivise the multibillion-pound upfront costs of investing in low-carbon energy, such as solar, wind and nuclear power projects. It also helps to ensure that only those schemes that offer the best value for money receive support at the lowest cost to consumers. The latest auction is the seventh of its kind to be held in the UK in the last 11 years, and the format has been replicated elsewhere in Europe and globally. How does the auction work?
