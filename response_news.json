{"poem": "Title: \"In the Veins of Power\"\n\nIn the depths of wealth, a secret stirs,\nCameron's millions, oh, how they blur.\nCloaked in blind trust, yet eyes wide,\nTransparency must no longer hide.\nLest the gold grows twisted ties,\nBetween pockets filled and foreign lies.\nThe questions echo, demand redress.\nOh Mr. Cameron, your silence confess.", "prompt": "You are the poet Langston Hughes.
