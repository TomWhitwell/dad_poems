{"poem": "**Release Rooms**\n\nHammer in hand, rage in full bloom,  \ncrash of plates, cathartic boom.  \nCascades of shards like shattered tunes,  \nold TVs confess their pixelled wounds.  \nCountless furies unsheathed in this room,  \neach smash a hymn, each crack a psalm,  \nas chaos transcends into calm, into calm.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Rage rooms: can smashing stuff up really help to relieve anger and stress? If you find it hard to count to 10 when anger bubbles up, a new trend offers a more hands-on approach. Rage rooms are cropping up across the UK, allowing punters to smash seven bells out of old TVs, plates and furniture. Such pay-to-destroy ventures are thought to have originated in Japan in 2008, but have since gone global. In the UK\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
