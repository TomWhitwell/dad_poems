{"poem": "Title: Margarine Memories\n\nMargarine maiden in the apron of youth, \nBaking blocks of yesteryear seeped in truth.\nMeeting the 60s in Truro, under ration's reign, \nScones born of sacrifice, kneaded in the grain.\nFingers stained by memories, the past on her palate,\nNot for posh bakers' butter, her thrifty sonnet.\nWoken not by wokery, but recall's sweet decree,\nHome's recipe, bound always, in vegetable decree.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
