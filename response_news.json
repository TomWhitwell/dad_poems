{"poem": "\"Cartography of Democracy\"\n\nOn this summer morning, \nChange is in the air.\nHundreds of landscapes redrawn,\nAn election's game of musical chairs.\n\nDewy dawns in different districts,\nThe echo of the voters' debate.\nNew names, inked boundaries, definitions;\nIn a carousel of democracy, we rotate.\n \nIn booths, a whisper of graphite,\nThe quiet carving of a nation's fate.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"What constituency am I in?: new boundary map for UK general election \u2013 and how changes may affect you The general election on 4 July will be fought across 650 new constituencies after boundary changes were approved by parliament. With only 77 constituencies remaining unchanged, the boundary review changes which seat many people will be voting in. Not only does it mean that seats may have a new name, but geographical changes to seat boundaries\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
