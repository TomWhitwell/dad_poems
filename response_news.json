{"poem": "Title: In Nairobi's Beating Heart\n\nJane sweeps through serpentine slums, a testament\nto floods that mourned her home away.\nBrocade of tin roofs sings, whistling to the tides,\nWhere Mathare River, choked with yesterday,\nruns like a vein through heart-soft mud.\nIn this metronome of anxious days,\nShe arrays herself in resilience, and in Nairobi's pulse,\nFinds a rhythm that stays.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

Ever since the devastating floods that forced her out of her home last month, she and other residents who live by the rubbish-choked Mathare River, which runs through their area of Nairobi, have begun an anxious countdown. It is only a matter\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
