{"poem": "**Rubbish Reverie**\n\nEach bin, a colored confession,  \nbearing secrets of daily life.  \nInto the trucks they vanish,  \nlike dreams swallowed by morning light.  \nPlastic whispers merge with glassy wails,  \npaper trails crumpled in resigned sighs.  \nWhere do the tales of trash take flight?  \nIn landfill tombs, buried truths lie.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Waste Wars by Alexander Clapp review \u2013 the filthy truth about trash You know the drill: plastic and glass containers go in the blue recycling bin, paper and cardboard in the blue sack, vegetable matter in the green compost bin, and the rest in the grey general rubbish bin. Households up and down the land go through variations of these familiar refuse-sorting tasks each week. But where does it actually all go? Into the trucks\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Waste Wars by Alexander Clapp review \u2013 the filthy truth about trash You know the drill: plastic and glass containers go in the blue recycling bin, paper and cardboard in the blue sack, vegetable matter in the green compost bin, and the rest in the grey general rubbish bin.
