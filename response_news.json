{"poem": "**Beechworth Echoes**\n\nIn sandstone silence, history whispers,  \nGold-veined in the earth's old heart.  \nThe Wiradjuri and their kin listen,  \nUnder waterfalls of forgotten past.  \nMusic mingles with the rush of time,  \nWhere wine stains lips, and dreams unweave\u2014  \nIn Beechworth, where echoes gather,  \nA tapestry of existence, quietly weaves.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
