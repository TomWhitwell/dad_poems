{"poem": "Title: \"Vovchansk's Echo\"\n\nUnder the grey drone-clouded ceiling, \nUkraine inches forth, house by house.\nTwo Russians vanish into roofless ruin,\nFootprints teasing tales over vegetable patch.\nLives churned to charcoal,\nStreets whisper names: Hoholia, Travnia.\nOnce home to 17,000 souls \nNow emptiness echoes in Vovchansk. \nBorn of flesh, reduced to dust,\nYet, in each shell-dinted stone,\nHope resists, resilience remains.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Under a drone-filled sky, Ukraine tries to retake a town, one house at a time The two Russian soldiers jogged across an apocalyptic landscape. They kept going, zigzagging over a vegetable patch. At the intersection between Hoholia and Travnia streets, the pair disappeared into a roofless brick building. Around them was the ruined town of Vovchansk. It was a smouldering hell of blackened blocks of flats and shell-dinted cottages. Vovchansk, once home to about 17,000\".
