You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Trump steps up Greenland annexation demand and attacks European leaders at Davos Donald Trump has stepped up his demand to annex Greenland but said the US would not use force to seize it during a rambling, invective-laden speech at Davos where he once again lashed out at Europe\u2019s political leaders. The address to thousands of business and political leaders at the World Economic Form in the Swiss ski resort indicated that while the US president was renouncing the use of military force \u2013 for now at least \u2013 to wrest control of Greenland, he still intended to wield America\u2019s economic and diplomatic power to bend European allies to his will. He said he was \u201cseeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use force. I won\u2019t use force. All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.\u201d The remarks elicited a cool reaction from the foreign minister of Denmark, the Nato country of which Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory. Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen said it was \u201cpositive\u201d that Trump had ruled out an invasion but the US president\u2019s ambitions for the territory were \u201cintact\u201d. \u201cIt is, in isolation, positive that it is being said that military force will not be used, but that does not make the problem go away,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cThe challenge is still there.\u201d\".
