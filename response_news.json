{"poem": "Title: \"Echoes of the Silent Call\"\n\nFrom McGill: hunger, youth's battle-rattle, unseen.\nFasting as mouths scream, vowing, silence keen.\nIn the global classroom, voices blend into one cry,\nAgainst hollow thunder from an unjust sky. \nFor three weeks they starve, for peace they strive,\nIn the cold Canadian snow, their protest thrives.\nFreedom songs hang like breath in winter's dread,\nIn a world that strains to listen, where dreams are fed.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
