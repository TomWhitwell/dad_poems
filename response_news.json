{"poem": "\"Ode to the Peregrine's Quest\"\n\nAs dawn cloaks the Cape in radiant hue,\nThe Peregrine, for lofty quests due, \nRoars to the sky in Apollo's wake,\nA celestial path, it dares to take.\nIts flight renewed in morning's light,\nEchoing man's eternal fight.\nTo touch once more the moon's cold face,\nIn the infinite, silent embrace.", "prompt": "You are the poet Homer.
