{"poem": "Title: \"A Storm Comes East\"\n\nSnowfall whispers in the north while\nRain's insistent argument\nInundates Gulf coast breaths.\nA cyclonic waltz, spinning East,\nUnsettles certainty even in sleep.\nOur cities, small dolls in winter's clutch,\nAwait the quiet of the snowfall's touch.\nDrape the dawn in white, silence me,\nWinter, in your icy tranquility.", "prompt": "You are the poet Sylvia Plath.
