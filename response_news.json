{"poem": "**The Power of Tomorrow**  \n\nGoogle plugs into the atom's hum,  \nwith hands that shape uranium and sun.  \nIn fission's glow, visions twine and spread,  \nAI dreams cradled where electrons thread.  \nPixels bloom in nuclear's silent roar,  \nas tech giants ink lines on the earth's core.  \nEnlightened, or a Pandora's trick play?  \nWhat light, what shadow will dawn convey?", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

If you were looking for an inkblot test for your view of big tech\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence, you could hardly do better than the news that Google is ordering the construction of at least six small nuclear reactors to power the growth of the technology. Here, in one view, is an enlightened business leveraging its size\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
