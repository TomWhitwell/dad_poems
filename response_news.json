{"poem": "**The Silent Court**\n\nIn Walthamstow's grey shadow,  \nA life extinguished, worn thin  \nBy whispered violence. Justice,  \nA specter in the coroner's light,  \nDeliberates the echoes of pain,  \nWhere love once grew, now barren.  \nCompassion falters, questions linger\u2014  \nA plea drowned in silence,  \nYet her voice, still unmet, haunts  \nThe halls of unyielding stone.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
