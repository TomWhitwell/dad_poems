{"poem": "Title: \"An Unfinished Journey\"\n\nIn waters did the lost one stray.\nWhere whispers tell of Norwich's day.\nMissing, no sight - in dismay.\nGaynor's path, in currents held sway.\n\nBelongings stay, memories fray,\nFrom city centre to Wensum's bay.\nA tale of tears in the clay,\nThe river owns her ballet.\n\nMother, worker, heart's mainstay,\nIn water's arms, she finds her way.", "prompt": "You are the poet Gwendolyn Brooks.
