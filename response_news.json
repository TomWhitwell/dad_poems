You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018The bathrooms were rank, but we didn\u2019t care\u2019: how the grimy-but-great CBGB changed rock for ever Fifty years ago, a dive bar in New York\u2019s East Village started to attract attention as a new hub for rock music. Initially, this was&nbsp;a whisper conveyed in a handful of small-circulation music&nbsp;magazines. Then, celebrated musicians, record label executives, hip&nbsp;journalists and photographers, followed by the influencers of that era,&nbsp;began making a beeline for 315 Bowery, the home of CBGB. Inside, an array of young, unknown artists were making music that would change rock\u2019s sound and look, attitude and aesthetic. These outsiders created a template for punk, spoken word, powerpop, new wave, no wave, mutant funk, hardcore and so much more besides. Despite closing its doors two decades ago, CBGB remains a totemic venue in the history of modern music. Now the venue\u2019s heyday is being marked with a&nbsp;four-CD box set that celebrates an era when New York City was cheap to live in, and artistic rather than commercial. The CBGB story centres on Hillel \u201cHilly\u201d Kristal. Born in New York in 1931 to Russian Jewish immigrants, Kristal served as a marine, sang in folk clubs and then booked artists for the Village Vanguard jazz club, before opening Hilly\u2019s, a Greenwich Village bar featuring live gigs. After neighbours\u2019 complaints about \u201cloud music\u201d forced the venue to close in 1969, he leased 315 Bowery, reasoning no one would complain about noise on&nbsp;New York\u2019s \u201cskid row\u201d \u2013 his next-door neighbour, the Palace Hotel, mainly catered to homeless\".
