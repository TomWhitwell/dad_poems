{"poem": "Title: The Uncertain Distance\n\nA pensive man, now distant, \nholding mysteries within his gaze,\nFrustration stirs, love's constant haze.\n\nFive years of withered intimacy,\nquestions bloom, love's subtle dance.\nHis silence, casting doubts afoul - \nA silent, seething, secret glance.\n\nOh speak, the heart pleads,\nUnravel this thread, so tightly spun.\nFind the words, love's language lost,\nIn the quiet of doubts begun.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams.
