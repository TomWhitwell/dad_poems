{"poem": "Title: \"Winter's Newborn\"\n\nWithin the bitter white, a child,\nDiapered essence of innocence,\nMarked by errant stars, beguiled,\nThrough cities' cold indifference.\n\n\"Cruelty,\" they say, but who am I?\nTo condemn love's desperate roads,\nA fable etched in Old Bailey's sigh,\nAs winter unmasks parental codes.\n\nFour shadows haunt their weary eyes,\nA fifth light caught in selfish snow,\nHow stark the love that defies,\nIn the face of frigid woe.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
