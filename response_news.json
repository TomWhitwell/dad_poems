{"poem": "Title: In the Wake of Cardboard Boats\n\nBoxes laden, bubble-wrapped and corrugated,\nvessels of wants sailing on guilt's sea.\nUnveiling treasures wrapped in regret,\nthe new thing's thrill, fleeting as morning dew.\nExcess whispers in cardboard echoes,\nthe hidden cost, a currency of consequence.\nEven in silence, the footprint speaks.\nIn the wake of hollow abundance,\nWe become the custodians of our own undoing.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018Every package carries a hidden cost\u2019: is it better for the environment to shop online or in-store? Packages arrive at my house more than I\u2019d like to admit. Whether they contain cosmetics, swimwear, T-shirts or socks, the sight of a brown cardboard box makes me feel two things: excitement for the new thing and guilt over its environmental impacts. Often the packaging feels excessive: boxes inside bigger boxes, things wrapped in bubble wrap or corrugated\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
