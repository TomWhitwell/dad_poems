Devoted care, weekend afternoons dedicated to careful propagation, gentle misting, regular watering. I\u2019d carefully snip the brown bits off the edges of their leaves and delicately remove the buildup of dust with a microfibre cloth. My flat was a growing cornucopia of cacti and vines and succulents, all in a&nbsp;coterie of artisanal\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
