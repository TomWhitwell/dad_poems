{"poem": "**Palimpsest Sleeper**\n\nIn the three-tier night, India writes itself again\u2014  \ngrille-burn on the wrist, a window's iron prayer.  \nFifty hours unmoored, fifty degrees and rising,  \nplatforms spitting steam where water lands.\n\nRubber soles soften; time slumps.  \nYet strangers pass a cup, a name,  \nand the train's juddering song  \nsets bone to bone, layer on layer.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

They inscribe on the mind our fellow travellers, our ways, our thousand languages, our landscapes, our climate.

The frazzled train fell off any semblance of a schedule. The voyage grew longer, past 50 hours; hotter, past 50C. I remember the metallic burn on the window grilles; the hot, killing wind that blew through them; the sizzle of water drops splashed on the face when theyhit the uncovered platforms in the heart of the country; the melt of my rubber soles. A fortnight later, having trekked to the mouth of a tributary of the Ganges, completing my expedition from the Arabian Sea to a Himalayan glacier, it was possible to look back on the rail ordeal with affection. I wonder, as I write, whether this memory seeped into the heat-addled odyssey made by the runaway protagonist of my novel Railsong.
