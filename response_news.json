{"poem": "**Uneven Programme**\n\nMorning paper open like a score.  \nTchaikovsky storms in, boots on the rug,  \nthen Bonis, five minutes of harp-water.  \n\nBut it's Phibbs who tidies the room:  \nbass pizzicatos tapping light,  \na cello speaking low, unshowy,  \nthrough aubade shimmer, elegy pulse,  \nnocturne's bird-cries,  \nending in a vocalise\u2014  \nradiant, as if the hall remembered  \nhow to breathe.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"BBCSO/Schuldt review \u2013 Phibbs cello concerto brings cohesion to uneven programme Performances aside, this somewhat frenetic concert could have benefited from a sharper curatorial eye to bind together its disparate works. Fortunately, Joseph Phibbs\u2019s cello concerto, written for Guy Johnston and here receiving its world premiere, brought its own musical cohesion, distinguishing itself in an otherwise uneven programme. Scrupulously crafted, its five contrasting movements basked in a warm tonality and boasted a multihued orchestration with rich, fluent string writing and imaginative effects in wind, brass and percussion. Emerging from gentle double bass pizzicatos and cushioned cellos, Johnston\u2019s solo line, pensive and unshowy throughout, was neatly framed thanks to Clemens Schuldt\u2019s mindful control over his BBC Symphony Orchestra forces. The shimmering, shuddering Aubade, brimming with light and dancing counterpoint, gave way to the mournful Elegy, a long cello threnody stretched out over a pulsing orchestral heartbeat. An eerie Nocturne, tense and agitated, was haunted by the cries of night-birds and perhaps something more sinister, before the wistful Vocalise brought this attractive new concerto to a radiant conclusion. Elsewhere matters were less consistent. Tchaikovsky\u2019s Hamlet, a prolix tone poem complete with stentorian ghost, Russian-accented Ophelia and a brusque military intervention, got a kick up the backside from Schuldt whose clipped, brittle reading was undoubtedly exciting, if low on warmth. At just five minutes, Mel Bonis\u2019s Oph\u00e9lie, one of the late-Romantic composer\u2019s enthralling series of musical sketches of iconic women, proved that less is often more.
