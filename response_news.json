{"poem": "Title: \"Ascend Cangshan, Seek Peace\"\n\nAutumn leafed in Dali, aught by Silver Bridge, \nObserved the ridge-line's stoic, thousand-year blink.\nIt towered, Cangshan, over valley and village, \nA daily beckon - a siren inked in sky-edge.\n\nEchoing east, whispers of 'Dalifornia',\nNine months in its thrall, a foreign explorer.\nI cast my eyes heavenward, heart bound to follow,\nScaling that sentinel, peace in its shadow.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.

Each morning, I had looked up at the top of its imposing ridge line, 2,000m above the village of Silver Bridge, north of Dali\u2019s historic old town, that for a while I called home. Eighteen\".
