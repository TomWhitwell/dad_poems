{"poem": "\"Of Caged Trains and Lost Journeys\"\n\nBristol bathed in merciless rain-blight,\nIts veins of iron silenced by the swell.\nIn Privatisation's shroud, a bitter plight -\nno one's sin, yet all's private hell.\nLate-light trapped by the hushed network,\nstill echoes the rhythms of industrial ghost.\nA nation's pulse stuttered, frenzied and irked -\nInfrastructure's victim, humanity's host.", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative.

By the time I reached Bristol, at 5pm, all trains to the south-west had been cancelled, because of rising flood waters. It was no one\u2019s fault \u2013 just one of life\u2019s vicissitudes. What happened next was a different matter. I believe I\u2019m still suffering the effects of it: I think privatisation has made me\".
