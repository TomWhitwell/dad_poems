{"poem": "Title: \"Canvas of Sudan\"\n\nAn elegy woven in the loom of despair,\nInvisible atrocities dressed in silence.\nChildren weep not from scraped knees, but from hunger,\nShadows of parents echoing in their fading heartbeats.\nRunning yet rooted to the burnt earth,\nStray leaves caught in a cruel wind.\nUnseen, unheard, our chosen ignorance wraps their sorrow,\nA bitter burial shroud for the living.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"The Observer view on Sudan\u2019s civil war: a humanitarian disaster we choose to ignore Parents are killed in front of their children. As they cry for help, the children die too. Panicked people fleeing attacks become moving targets. Entire communities are set ablaze and destroyed. Dislocation, hunger and thirst follow, a prelude to famine and death.&nbsp;Abandoned, terrified, unprotected, unseen, the people despair. This is not a description of Gaza today. It\u2019s Sudan, war-torn, desperate \u2013\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "The Observer view on Sudan\u2019s civil war: a humanitarian disaster we choose to ignore Parents are killed in front of their children.
