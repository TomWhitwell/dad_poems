{"poem": "Title: The Ritual of Motion\n\nA cross-legged ode to health,\nMan, bound by self-imposed stealth.\nLeg over leg in humble sway,\nStealing minutes from the day.\nTo rise, sans hands, a task unbowed,\nNo heaven's aid here allowed.\nIn genuflection on this floor,\nWhere kneecap meets its hardwood moor,\nEchoes old, in quietude kneel,\nA sonnet spun in life's spinning wheel.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Six fast, easy ways to improve your mobility \u2013 and live a longer life Remember the mobility challenge that went viral last year? It goes like this. You\u2019re standing up; you can\u2019t use your hands, so start by crossing your arms across your body. Cross one leg in front of the other. Drop down to sit cross-legged on the floor. From here, get on your knees with your toes behind you. Now\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Touch your toes!
