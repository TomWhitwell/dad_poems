{"poem": "**September's Ritual**\n\nSeptember whispers soft renewal,  \nIn aisles of paper and unspoiled ink.  \nThe scent of new begins its annual  \nDance, where silence pauses to think.  \n\nWe clothe in routines threadbare yet dyed  \nIn fresh intent, the pages crisp,  \nWhile shunning summer's carefree stride,  \nTo hold autumn's disciplined lisp.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

As someone who spends an inordinate amount of time in stationery shops, I\u2019d posit that no, it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s just something about September that feels like a fresh start \u2013 whether that\u2019s cracking the spine of a new notebook or jamming your feet into shoes without toe posts for the first time\".
