{"poem": "Title: \"The Flat Landscape's Tale\"\n\nFlatlands whisper truths asunder,\nRail tracks trace their quiet wonder.\nBeneath the Dutch sky, wide and grand,\nWhere hill nor dale marks the land.\n\nPolder, heath, in morning's light,\nRewilding scenes take their flight.\nBeauty not in peak or crest,\nIn tranquil plains, we find our rest. \n\nOne does not need mount or ledge,\nTo reach life's wisdom's edge,\nFor even on a 'pancake' expanse,\nLies a world in a single glance.", "prompt": "You are the poet Vikram Seth. You woke up this morning feeling wistful. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Rail route of the month: rewilding, polders and Hanseatic beauty by train in the Netherlands There are train journeys where one just gazes at hills rolling by beyond the carriage window. I love such routes, be they in the Alps, Iberia or the Balkans. Things are different in the Netherlands, where pancake-flat landscapes dominate. Yet even in the flatlands there is often visual drama. The rail routes skirting Dutch heathlands around Apeldoorn are wonderful. And\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
