Not that I\u2019m shaming you for less than youthful skin on your d\u00e9colletage \u2013 surely you know me better than&nbsp;that. And you may well be immaculately well preserved under the collar, as it were, if you\u2019ve been using your lotions and potions right down to your bra, as we are instructed to by\".
