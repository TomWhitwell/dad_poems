{"poem": "Title: Harrogate in Season's Embrace \n\nAmid gritstone robed in snow, Harrogate\nSpeaks, a Victorian whisper of yesteryears.\nHer charm, a carousel around my thoughts,\nMarked by festooning shops and laughter of souls.\nThe Sleigh & Reindeers, a reprieve draped in tinsel,\nCradling Christmas in a glass of mirth,\nHarrogate, mother of my winter's hush,\nEchoes forth from the quiet end of the year.", "prompt": "You are the poet Saeed Jones. You woke up this morning feeling idyllic. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Just for Christmas: the Harrogate pub that becomes the Sleigh & Reindeers Few towns wear their Christmas ornaments with the charm and panache of Harrogate. Perhaps it\u2019s the mass of wonderful gritstone buildings and all the Victorian shop windows that seem from a bygone age. My end point will be the Coach &amp; Horses on West Park \u2013 which has changed its name to the Sleigh &amp; Reindeers for the festive season. The route passes\".
