{"poem": "Title: Veins of Clay\n\nIn the promise of dawn, the cries of the dispossessed,\nEtching sorrow in the sinews of Gaza. A sigh,\nPart prayer, part mourning, drapes over Rafah's ruins.\nWhile the White House, its walls of alabaster silence,\nSeek answers where scars speak more than words.\nIn the swinging cathedral's censer, sorrow burns;\nCan man shape mercy with hands still soiled by cruelty?", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
