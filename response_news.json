Skin's the thin veneer  \nbetween us and the sun's hot interrogation,  \nyet we agonize over the stitch, the fit,  \nthe ceremonial ascent from knee to thigh\u2014  \ndreading exposure while craving it,  \nas if the heat might reveal what winter coats  \nhave kept concealed.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"From budget sunnies to the perfect semi-short shorts: 69 summer style updates and hacks There is a very specific panic around summer dressing \u2013 all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums.\".
