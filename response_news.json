{"poem": "**Midsummer Reverie**\n\nIn the land where the day leans long,  \na ring of oak and ash embraces the sun.  \nVoices blend in twilight's gentle song,  \nnameless dances twirl 'til time's undone.  \n  \nLaughter rises, a spiral into dusk,  \nmirth weaving through the slender heaven.  \nFires flicker, a breathing, glowing husk,  \nas shadows stretch beneath the leavened sky.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
