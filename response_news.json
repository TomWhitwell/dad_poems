{"poem": "Title: Ode to the Chocolate Maven\n\nChantal danced a cocoa waltz,\nIn Rococo's mirrored halls.\nHer sweet-toothed confections were once exiled,\nBut for karma, the curtain falls.\n\nAn OBE crown adorning her craft,\nHer hands speak chocolate lore,\nThe priciest chocs on our greedy map,\nTales of sweets, and times of yore.\n\nEmbrace the gilt, sample the grandeur,\nIn each delicate, dream-wrought gram,\nFor in Coady's hands, chocolate is enchantment,\nA symphony, a psalm.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
