{"poem": "Title: \"Absence in the Abacus\"\n\nIn our pockets, the absent coin whispers, \nlost in the vaulted silence of transatlantic haunts.\nLeviathans of commerce, breach only to breathe out\nnotes of deception, their song the dark hymn of deficit.\nPay what is due or become a parable,\nfor in the ragged wake of austerity, the school, the hospital, the heart,\nbleed crimson ink for love's lost pounds.", "prompt": "You are the poet Carol Ann Duffy. You woke up this morning feeling melancholic.

The suspected deficit is 14% higher than the figure from the previous year, and would mean US companies now make up nearly half of underpaid tax into British coffers from foreign companies. A total of \u00a311.5bn in missing tax is suspected\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
