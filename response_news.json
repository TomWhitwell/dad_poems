You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I had 25 addresses in 20 years \u2013 but now I\u2019ve created the beginnings of a new life | Jay Bernard After a while, you want to live alone. And then it happens and you discover everything that\u2019s difficult about it. You realise that you didn\u2019t really want to live alone, you were just sad and alienated in your old life. The pandemic reshuffled society in a way that could not be anticipated. Sometimes it\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
