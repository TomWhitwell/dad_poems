A Sociopath\u2019s Guide to a&nbsp;Successful Marriage by MK Oliver (Hemlock, \u00a316.99)Former headteacher Oliver\u2019s first novel centres on yummy mummy Lalla Rook, who lives with her banker husband Stephen and their young children Nelly and Nathan in the&nbsp;leafy north London suburb of Muswell Hill. It\u2019s a privileged existence, but Lalla, who is not only admirably resourceful but also manipulative and utterly lacking in empathy, has her eye on a larger house in considerably pricier Hampstead as well as a place at an exclusive school for Nelly, who is already demonstrating that\".
