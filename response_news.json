You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Some of world\u2019s oldest trees hit by climate-fuelled wildfires in Patagonia The climate crisis inflamed deadly wildfires that left 23 people dead in Chile and devastated forests in Argentina that host some of the world\u2019s oldest trees, scientists have found. The hot, dry and windy conditions that enabled the fires to blaze across huge areas in January were made about three times more likely by global heating, researchers from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium found. Parts of Chile and Argentina are experiencing significantly drier summers as a result of human-caused carbon emissions, with rainfall now 25% lower in early summer in Chile and 20% lower in the affected region of Patagonia. Severe wildfires left the Chilean regions of Biob\u00edo and \u00d1uble in a \u201cstate of catastrophe\u201d in mid-January and killed 23 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and forced 52,000 people to flee. The fires were driven by temperatures exceeding 37C and strong winds. In Argentina, wildfires broke out in early January, affecting the Unesco-listed Los Alerces national park in Patagonia, home to ancient alerce trees that can live for more than 3,000 years. The damage is thought to have been worsened by large budget cuts to fire management services by the government led by Javier Milei, who has called the climate crisis a \u201csocialist lie\u201d.
