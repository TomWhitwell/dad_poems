{"poem": "### Brickwork\n\nGranite crumbles to man's relentless pace,  \nwheelbarrow wheels mark ancient grace;  \nwhere bombs have sewn, there's dust we heap,  \ndiggers prowl where shadows sleep.  \nIn gardens of snow, a circle's dream,  \nstone whispers stories unspoken, unseen;  \nthrough bricks and mortar, horizons charted,  \nby hands of builders, Earth disheartened.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Architecton review \u2013 poetic study of humankind\u2019s bricks-and-mortar impact on the Earth The granite face of a quarry shatters into boulders, cascading in mesmerising slow motion; a man with a wheelbarrow potters around the Roman ruins at Baalbek in Lebanon; bulldozers and diggers pick over the shattered fragments of a bombed-out Ukrainian housing complex; an Italian architect commissions a stone circle for his garden, hovering fretfully as the landscapers toil in the snow to finish\".
