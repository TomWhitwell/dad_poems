You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"If you really care about animals, stop eating them | Letters Your editorial applauds the government for rearranging the furniture in a burning house (The Guardian view on animal welfare: a timely reminder that cruelty is wrong, 23 December). Fewer cages, gentler gas, a close season for hares. All very civilised. Yet the central obscenity remains untouched. We are still breeding, confining and killing animals by the billion, then praising ourselves for marginally reducing the panic and pain along the way. This strategy treats animal suffering the way Victorian engineers treated cholera. Add a valve here, a filter there, and never question the sewer itself. One billion chickens a year is not an ethical problem that can be solved with better regulations. It is a moral failure so large it has become invisible, like traffic noise. The state recognises animals as \u201csentient beings\u201d while organising their lives around maximised throughput and minimised cost. That is not compassion. It is bureaucratic anaesthesia. Your editorial gestures toward the real issues \u2013 climate damage, wildlife loss, the need to reduce meat consumption \u2013 then hurriedly looks away. This is the familiar dance of British politics. Everyone knows the answer, but nobody wants to say it out loud because it might upset farmers, voters or the ghost of Sunday roast. So we get a strategy that asks how to kill animals more nicely instead of why we insist on killing them at all. Veganism is not a lifestyle garnish or a boutique moral pose.\".
