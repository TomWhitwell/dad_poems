Both were tipped over, rubbish everywhere. A trail of messy clues that would no doubt lead to a very happy perpetrator. The upturned table, the gas cooker on the back lawn, tins of beans crushed by a sizeable jaw, the toilet door\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
