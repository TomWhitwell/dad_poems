{"poem": "Title: \"The Marvels' Crusade: A Morn's Musings\"\n\nIn their vast cosmopolis of light and colour,\nHeroes prowl. Streams of power intertwining,\nAn exchange of might, a silent, earthly wonder.\nWise Carol, endowed with cosmic grandeur,\nFinds her strength in Wanda's eyes now twining.\nYet, in this lively saga, the question hovers:\nIs not life itself the mightiest of marvels?", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
