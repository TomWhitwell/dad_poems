You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"In the age of the \u2018rough sex defence\u2019, Emerald Fennell\u2019s treatment of Wuthering Heights\u2019 Isabella Linton is grotesque Tragedy is the beating heart of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights; it\u2019s a gothic novel that takes place in a society built on hierarchy and oppression, and exposes the fragility of love and how easily it is distorted into dangerous obsession. Unsurprisingly, there is no happy ending. Although every character in the novel is stalked by tragedy, few suffer as much as Isabella Linton. Unaware of Heathcliff\u2019s vindictive motives, she becomes trapped in an intensely abusive marriage, one she is only freed from by fleeing to London. While she is undoubtedly a victim, in the end the character also has agency; Isabella is able to escape her abuser, though not without considerable scars. It\u2019s a pivotal moment for her character, and one that she\u2019s been stripped of in Emerald Fennell\u2019s quote-unquote \u201cadaptation\u201d. Fennell is no stranger to courting controversy, with much criticism directed at the film, chiefly regarding the conspicuous \u201cwhitewashing\u201d of Heathcliff and erasure of regional authenticity. Having already expunged Heathcliff\u2019s ethnicity to facilitate a romantic fantasy, Fennell has reduced Isabella to a willing BDSM participant; chained and treated like a dog, she consents to this humiliation. Though this may seem like a tantalising scene for those unfamiliar with the source material, Isabella has essentially become the dog that Heathcliff hangs in the novel. Once you have that context, it\u2019s rather difficult to look past the fetishisation of Isabella\u2019s degradation. Related: Wuthering\".
