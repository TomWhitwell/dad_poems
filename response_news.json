{"poem": "Title: \"Ode to the Ignored Warning\"\n\nTen years past, we whispered of a keyless nightmare,\nSoft alarms in corridors of industry, unheard.\nWheels turned, engines hummed, silence filled the assembly air,\nAs technology danced, with security's word deferred.\n\nNow, thwarted locks and stolen rides echo our tale,\nAn unwanted ballet of metal, software, and disregard.\nA silent chorus in the night, draped in aggressive veil,\nWhere the owners wake to nothing, their vacancy revealed.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Revealed: car industry was warned keyless vehicles vulnerable to theft a decade ago The car industry ignored warnings more than a decade ago that keyless technology on modern vehicles risked a surge in vehicle thefts, an investigation by the Observer can reveal. Legal and computer researchers claimed keyless entry and vehicle software would be \u201csubverted\u201d because of inadequate security. The industry was warned of research that car owners could \u201cexpect to find their cars stolen\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
