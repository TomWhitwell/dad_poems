You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Snow Patrol\u2019s Gary Lightbody: \u201820,000 people were giving me the finger\u2019 What\u2019s the first rule of patrolling the snow? Is it: don\u2019t eat yellow snow? The first rule is don\u2019t talk about patrolling the snow. We were originally called Polar Bear. I was at Dundee university and saw a friend of mine on the street who said, \u201cHow\u2019s your band going? How\u2019s Snow Patrol?\u201d I was like: \u201cMan, we\u2019re called Polar Bear. I don\u2019t know\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
