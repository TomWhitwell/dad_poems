{"poem": "**Tariffs and Borders**\n\nIn the dance of power, shadows stretch,  \nAcross the silent lines drawn on maps.  \nCold words spill from gilded lips,  \nLike winter winds that bite and snap.  \nYet across the divide, whispers rise\u2014  \nOf roots entwined beneath the earth,  \nWhere tariffs cannot reach,  \nAnd economies pulse in silent rebirth.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
