You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018I was so, so stupid\u2019: how Animalia and The Eleventh Hour made Graeme Base an unlikely bestseller It is so often the case that the best children\u2019s books are the ones adults think children won\u2019t like \u2013 too difficult, too weird, too wordy. Graeme Base seems to specialise in these. Like his alphabet book Animalia, which has sold five million copies around the world, packed with Base\u2019s opulent, detailed, downright bizarro illustrations and a flashy alliterative vocabulary. How many kids\u2019 books contain sentences like: \u201cVictor V. Vulture, the vaudeville ventriloquist, versatile virtuoso of vociferous verbosity, vexatiously vocalising at the Valhalla Variety Venue\u201d? And how many of you reading this still remember that word-for-word? Or The Eleventh Hour, his picture book mystery about an elephant\u2019s 11th birthday party where, at 11 o\u2019clock, all the food is stolen; the reader must identify the thief through fiendishly difficult puzzles including ciphers, morse code and symbols hidden everywhere in the illustrations, even the page margins. Both Animalia and The Eleventh Hour have been selected by Guardian readers as among the 50 best Australian picture books ever published \u2013 but if you pitched either book now, Base says, \u201cyou\u2019d fail \u2013 miserably, I suspect\u201d. It was perhaps a strength that the 67-year-old, by his own admission, had no idea what he was doing when he started. Take his beautiful typography in the illustrations of Animalia: \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to do that!\u201d he laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have all the text separate so you can translate\".
