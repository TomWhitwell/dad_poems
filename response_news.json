{"poem": "\"Ode to a Pirate King Vanished in Time\"\n\nThrough the morning's foggy newsprint page,\nI trace the ghost of Henry, rogue of the age.\nHe danced with Neptune, silver, gold and gem,\nEvaporating like mist, escaping them.\nHis story drips, an unfinished swirl,\nA fable spun for each gullible earl,\nLost on the crest of yesteryear's wave,\nA pirate king, forever brave.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
