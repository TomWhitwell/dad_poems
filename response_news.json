But we have more important things to discuss with them | Simon Jenkins Once upon a time Britain would have sent a gunboat up the Yangtze River. That would teach those Chinese a lesson. To hear some MPs talk about Beijing\u2019s espionage activities, you would think gunboats were already on their way. Of course, it is malicious and hurtful for a foreign state patently to hack into Britain\u2019s\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
