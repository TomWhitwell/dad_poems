{"poem": "Title: Irony Carved in Winter's Heart\n\nScissorhands, sheared snowflakes aloft at Sadler's Wells,\nA Christmas mockery in cold steel whimsy.\nDifference cradled in stark puppet's palms,\nAn icy hymn, bleeding acceptance's warmth.\nCarved from celluloid dreams, etched in pain,\nThompson's vision blooms within Bourne's icy reign.\nHow tenderly oddity dances on stage,\nLife's irony clad in a Burtonesque cage.", "prompt": "You are the poet Ted Hughes.

Edward Scissorhands is a particularly good fit not only for the snow that drifts down from the rafters, but also for the tenderly presented message nestled in its heart about difference and acceptance. It\u2019s a production, cleverly adapted by Caroline Thompson from the 1990 Tim Burton film, that\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
