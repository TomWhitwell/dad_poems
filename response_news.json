{"poem": "\"Recollections in Primate Lands\"\n\nChimp faces in mind's basin, deep as peat,\nEtched by jollity, by love, less by defeat.\nForged by handshakes, kinship strong -\nDividing lines in memory's song.\nThey carry echoes of primal joy,\nThrough shadow's cast and age's ploy.\nRediscovered, faces bloom again,\nA testament of friendship, born in ancient rain.", "prompt": "You are the poet Seamus Heaney. You woke up this morning feeling earnest. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Chimps can recognise peers decades later \u2013 especially if they got on well Whether it is a sea of faces at a school reunion or distant family at a wedding, our ability to remember people we met years ago can come in handy. Now it seems our evolutionary cousins have a similar skill. Researchers have found bonobos and chimpanzees can recall peers they spent time with in the past, even if they have been separated\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "Chimps can recognise peers decades later \u2013 especially if they got on well Whether it is a sea of faces at a school reunion or distant family at a wedding, our ability to remember people we met years ago can come in handy.
