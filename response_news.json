{"poem": "Title: \"The Failure Line\"\n\nNationalism crows at morning's break,\nOn broken promises, we futilely wake.\nPotholes and fractures adorn our land,\nA failed continuum, a weakling's hand.\n\nIn the acid of confusion, our trust decays,\nThe political castles, in spectral array\nUnanswered challenges, large and small,\nWithin our hearts, a nation's fall.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"On challenges big and small, our leaders haven\u2019t learned that nationalism is not the answer | Rafael Behr Brexit isn\u2019t working, and there are potholes everywhere. Those are not equivalent challenges. Fresh asphalt heals cracked carriageways in an afternoon. Repairing a fractured continental alliance is the work of a generation. One problem did not cause the other. But they are on the vast continuum of political failure \u2013 from global to local \u2013 that coincides\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long. You may add a one line title at the top if you like.", "news": "On challenges big and small, our leaders haven\u2019t learned that nationalism is not the answer | Rafael Behr Brexit isn\u2019t working, and there are potholes everywhere.
