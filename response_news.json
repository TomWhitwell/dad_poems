{"poem": "### A Monument to Shame\n\nIn Gaza's shadow, words unravel,  \nDiplomacy's threadbare cloak torn,  \nSpilled blood writes history's ledger,  \nEach line a silent cry forlorn.  \nDays of anguish counted, not blessed,  \nHope wilts beneath war's cruel sun.  \nA world watches, complicit, marred,  \nWhile peace's promise comes undone.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Diplomacy\u2019s lowest point: how the Israel-Gaza conflict was mishandled George Mitchell, the great US advocate for the Northern Ireland peace agreement, described diplomacy as 700 days of failure and one of success. In Gaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it\".
