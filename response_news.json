{"poem": "### In the Shadow of Conflict\n\nThe land bleeds, shadow decays  \nUnseen by eyes turned away.  \nWords of power clash in the sky,  \nWhere innocence is but a whisper,  \nDrowned in the echo of steel  \nClang and mourning weeps  \nAgainst unmoved horizons.  \nIn the dust of ancient tales,  \nNew stories of sorrow  \nEtch themselves silently.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
