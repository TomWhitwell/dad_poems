{"poem": "Title: \"Drawbridge Disparity\"\n\nTesco towers, a fortress fair, where profits flutter high,\nMurphy reigns with silvered spoils, his blue-checkered sky.\nBut beneath the drawbridge waits, the legion tired and worn,\nTheir pockets lined with leaden coins, their faces etched in scorn.\nHeavenly boardroom, hellish floor; a tale as old as time,\nThe haves, the humble have-nots, in a pantomime.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
