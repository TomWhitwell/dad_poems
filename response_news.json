{"poem": "**The Rhinoceros in the Tent**\n\nIn the thin field of night  \na young man lies, not old, not fat,  \nand the throat's poor architecture  \nbetrays him.  \nFrom his small tent  \ncomes the hard bellows of an animal  \nhe never chose to be.  \nMorning: the nurse's silence,  \nthen the verdict.  \nWe are all, it seems,  \nborn with a door that won't stay open.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
