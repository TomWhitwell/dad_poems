{"poem": "\"Flushed with Greed\"\n\nThe loo of gold, missing from the stately hold,\nOnce sat grandly in an art show bold.\nStolen from Churchill's birthplace, so dignified,\nBy a thief whose audacious guilt couldn't hide.\nIn art's sordid underbelly, the tale unwinds,\nOf a lavatory heist that boggles minds.\nOh how victory's flush now seems so bleak,\nFor James \u2013 a flush four-point-eight million pounds deep.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
