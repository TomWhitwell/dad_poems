{"poem": "**The Silent Sanctuary**\n\nA Bengal tiger dreams  \nbeneath the cedar sky,  \nwhere bird songs are ephemeral,  \ncarried on winds of fever.  \n\nAmong whispers of cougars,  \na lynx's grace falls still,  \nas bobcats curl into elegies,  \nleaves turning with the air.  \n\nIn Washington's calm,  \ntwenty shadows take flight,  \nfur etched into the silence.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
