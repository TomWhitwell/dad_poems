{"poem": "\"Immortalised Arc\"\n\nBarely perceived in the realm of the pixelated,\nCroft, bound in her cornerstone of stereotype,\nUnravels her relics; in the dew of the floppy disc.\nEach leap a clunky riddle, each pause an echo,\nFaint as the grating wheel of a trolley,\nScreeching in the absence of the electronic whirl.\nIn the slow dance of these ancient mechanics,\nYields a tale, oft played, never quite tamed.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Cumbersome to operate, especially if you\u2019re used to automatic gears and sat nav. Quiet, apart from the odd squeaky wheel. Absolutely brilliant at doing what it was designed to do. And yours\".
