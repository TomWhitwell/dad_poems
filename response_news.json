You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Flawed council shake-up plans will not deliver savings | Letters Polly Toynbee is correct to point out the foolishness of a massive local government reorganisation, given other priorities (Is No 10 seeking its own destruction? Why else would it botch its council plans and hand a victory to Farage?, 18 February). What she does not mention is that this reorganisation will lead to a large increase in inequality. The district councils that are being abolished are rising from the ashes as town and parish councils and, unlike other councils, they can set their own precept and cannot be capped. The largest town councils have budgets of more than \u00a35m and more than 124 parish councils have budgets of over \u00a31m. These councils tend to be in the wealthier suburban and rural areas, and can protect their residents from austerity, unlike residents of large, disadvantaged urban areas. If you live in an area with a parish council, you will have a good library, open spaces and playgrounds will be well maintained, and you will have a thriving youth club. If you do not, your library will have closed and your playground will be covered in glass where the teenagers drink on a Saturday night following the closure of their youth club. The government is giving grants to disadvantaged areas, but they will revert to their previous state within a few years due to a lack of local government funding. Despite the warm words from the chancellor, the cuts continue.David KennedyMenston, West\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
