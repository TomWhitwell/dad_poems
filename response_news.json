{"poem": "Title: Nostalgia in Newsprint\n\nIn morning haze, Irish Times lays open,\nMurmuring tales of London jaunts and ink slingers,\nEcho of Banville's lilt on Amis' ghost,\nBooks, dinners, conversations in hushed tones unfolding.\nLondon calls, seeping into the marrow of my beat-born bones,\nA haunting elegy to eras cracked open,\nIn each word, a tale, to you I'm beholden.", "prompt": "You are the poet Allen Ginsberg. You woke up this morning feeling bittersweet. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Martin Amis remembered by John Banville At the end of the 1980s, when I was appointed books editor at the Irish Times, my predecessor in the job urged me to pop over to London for a couple of days, stay at a nice hotel, have a couple of good dinners, pay my respects to some of my counterparts over there, and call in on a few publishers to find out what they had coming up\".
