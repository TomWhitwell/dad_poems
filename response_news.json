{"poem": "**Keeping Cool**\n\nIn the hush of summer days,\ntrees spread their arms, casting \ncool whispers over the sidewalk,\nwhile the hose's spray becomes \na jeweled curtain, children laugh\nunder its brief rain. Evenings,\nwe sit still, listening for a breeze\nas the sky unwinds its creamy lullaby,\nand somewhere a fan hums a promise.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
