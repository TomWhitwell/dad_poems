{"poem": "Title: Brotherhood's Defiance \n\nThe fluttering flame of Pride, \ndoused, not quieted.\nThough vandals act in shadows,\nin daylight we continue,\nrainbows ascendant over scars of struggle.\nManhattan, steeped in breaking dawn,\nilluminates the resilience.\nUnseen hands that tore down flags,\ncannot smother rights birthed in courage,\nor silence the colours of diversity.\nLove thrives amidst the harshness,\nblooming freely, undeterred.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.
