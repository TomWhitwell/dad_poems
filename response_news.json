{"poem": "Title: On the Wings of the Muted\n\nCensor ascends, like the hawk's sharpened talon,\nUpon words of Asna, stirring courage born anew.\nThrough tabloids, truth forced to creep, a challenged sparrow,\nFrom the heart of Palestine, her stories flew.\n\nInnocence measured not by the age of flesh,\nBut the purity of hearts, in oppression's mesh.\nHold the echoes in your breath,\nHumanity stands against death.", "prompt": "You are the poet RS Thomas.

Don\u2019t hold your breath If you want to get ahead in life then I have some advice: keep your mouth shut about Palestine. Or, if you must say something, then make sure it is nuanced like \u2013 I\u2019m just paraphrasing a former Mossad agent here \u2013 no Palestinian over the age of four is an innocent civilian and they all deserve to\".
