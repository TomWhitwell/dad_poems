Among all the feelings and thoughts that she has had to wrestle with since the summer, disbelief is the emotion that Robyn Thomson still struggles with the most. \u201cYou never think it would happen to you,\u201d said Robyn. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think it happens to anyone.\u201d Robyn\u2019s mother, Yvonne Ford, had shown no signs of illness in the months after returning from her holiday in Morocco in February. She had spoken highly of the country and its people, and recommended it for future getaways. She had not realised that a seemingly harmless interaction with a puppy while sitting in the sun would cause so much damage. The signs of Yvonne\u2019s illness remained dormant for months until June, when she began to have flu-like symptoms. The headaches and fever that followed rapidly became more severe and the 59-year-old soon lost the ability to walk or eat. Robyn, a trained nurse, did not know what was causing her mother\u2019s sickness, nor did her doctors. By the time she was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with rabies, there was nothing anyone could do to save Yvonne\u2019s life. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d said Robyn, recalling her disbelief that such a small mark could have brought her world crashing down. \u201cI remember thinking it had to be something else, she hadn\u2019t been bitten or attacked.\u201d When Yvonne died on 11 June, she became only the seventh person since 2000\".
