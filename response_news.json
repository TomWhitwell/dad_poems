{"poem": "### Decoding Earth\n\nIn Belfast's storied halls, where past whispers blend with now,  \nAn accidental journey, from scoops of cream to ancient silt.  \nDreams of sweetcones melt into peat and pollen's silent vow,  \nWhere time's trembling voice speaks through layers expertly built.  \nIce-cream dreams dissolve, in icy depths we plough,  \nUncovering secrets to shield our fragile Earth somehow.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
