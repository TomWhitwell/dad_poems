Square-jawed and ruggedly suave, it\u2019s the face of a matinee idol with a dangerous edge. The quiff is well-coiffed but grey-flecked. That Marlboro Man chin looks unshaven by lunchtime. Those hooded eyes have a weary, lounge lizard quality. One of his first Hollywood parts was a 1997\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
