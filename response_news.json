You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"US launches airstrikes on dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria The US military conducted 10 strikes on more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria between 3 and 12 February as part of a campaign against the extremist group in Iraq and Syria. US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement on Saturday that the US had struck IS infrastructure and weapons storage targets. The attacks formed part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in which the US killed or captured what it said were IS fighters and hit more than 100 IS targets. The campaign began after a member of Syria\u2019s general security forces affiliated with IS ambushed US and Syrian forces in the city of Palmyra, killing two US soldiers and an interpreter, and wounding three members of the Syrian government forces. The US has led the international coalition to defeat IS in Syria and Iraq since 2014, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to defeat the radical group. In November, Syria officially joined the coalition and Washington has since turned towards Damascus as its principal anti-IS ally. Analysts warn that the group has been trying to reconstitute itself since the fall of Assad in December 2024, exploiting the security vacuum and weapons that flooded the country when Assad\u2019s soldiers abandoned their posts. On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, praised Damascus for its participation in the anti-IS coalition, welcoming the Syrian government\u2019s commitment to fully cooperate with the US and the global coalition.
