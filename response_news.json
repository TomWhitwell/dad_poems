{"poem": "Title: Journeying Iron Serpents\n\nIron serpents, slithering from London's bosom,\nPiercing the heart of the untamed Scottish moors.\nThrough dew-kissed dawn and evening's dusky bloom,\nThe rhythm of travel's mysterious allure.\nThe ORR's verdict, a rhapsody to the rails,\nUnfurls a narrative where destination and journey intertwines.\nIn the humming thrum of wheels, every tale prevails,\nEvery passenger, a poet, in the hallways of time.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.
