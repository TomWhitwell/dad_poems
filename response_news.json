{"poem": "### Phishing in Troubled Waters\n\nIn virtual realms, shadows play their game,\nA state's cold fingers, cloaked in friends' names,\nReaching through wires, breaching through trust,\nTurning steel into rust, bonds into dust.\nCivil hearts netted, in their webs of deceit,\nWhere sanctions and quests for truth discreet,\nA pixelated whisper, an unending fight,\nIn the twilight of data, we seek the light.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage.
