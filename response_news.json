{"poem": "\"Ode to the Body Shop\"\n\nHonour to the teen's vessel,\nThe Body Shop, emblem of struggle.\nBeneath 'tis a whiff of coconut,\nResiding on Christmas' tussle.\n\n\"Mourn not,\" I tell my youth,\nAnointing the world in balmy truth.\nThat bittersweet tang of rebellion nostalgia,\nMotherhood's cool, embracing mantra.\n\nThrough this gift, we breathe,\nIn products ethereal, beneath,\nAnimal love and politics interweave,\nIn the perfume of a Christmas Eve.", "prompt": "You are the poet Simon Armitage. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I would mourn The Body Shop \u2013 it was a gateway to politics for animal-obsessed teenagers like me \u2018This is a bit rubbish,\u201d my 16-year-old said as he handed me a Christmas present. I love it when that happens. It gives me the chance to be the cool maternal care-giver who doesn\u2019t sweat the small stuff, as opposed to the critical and unforgiving mother you read about in novels. It was a coconut body spray\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
