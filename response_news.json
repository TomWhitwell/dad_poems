{"poem": "\"From Pounds to Prayers\"\n\nThe pound weeps at what it's become,\na phoenix promised to rise from ashes.\nIn the commerce of hope and despair,\nnumbers weave tales of endless dance. \nMining hearts for gold, we tremble,\nbut the earth hardens against intrusive hands.\nYesterday's tears water tomorrow's gardens,\nyet, we are rich only in tomorrows.\nHow many turns till the corner breaks,\nanother dawn sold for a weaker dollar.", "prompt": "You are the poet Warsan Shire.
