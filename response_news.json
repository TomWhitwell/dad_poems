You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"I\u2019m sick of avocado toast \u2013 I just want to keep my local, untrendy cafe | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett What do James McAvoy and my three-year-old son have in common? Very little, you might think, notwithstanding their shared awareness of the book The Dinosaur That Pooped a Planet. Yet their lives overlap in a more tangible way, because they, along with Benedict Cumberbatch, patronise the same cafes on Hampstead Heath. Both actors have signed a petition protesting against the takeover of four family-owned north London cafes by the Australian-inspired chain Daisy Green. It\u2019s a move that has dismayed the local community, leading to protests, and threats of legal action against the landowner, the City of London Corporation, whose new funding model for green spaces prioritises \u201cincome generation\u201d. You\u2019re probably wondering why you should care, either about what Hollywood actors think, or about this notoriously chi-chi part of London. And yet, like them, and like me, you probably have a favourite cafe, one that feels very special. So please indulge me in describing mine: the Parliament Hill cafe, which has been run by the D\u2019Auria family for more than 40 years. It looks far from remarkable. Unlike the polished, trend-led interiors of the Daisy Green cafes \u2013 with their marble bars and high stools (God I hate high stools, an accessibility nightmare that feel specifically designed for rapid customer turnover), their lush, green hanging plants and twee parasols \u2013&nbsp;it isn\u2019t designed to look good on social media. This is a 1960s-style\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
