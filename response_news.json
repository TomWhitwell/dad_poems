{"poem": "\"Lines Changed, Tracks Unseen\"\n\nConfusion dances on metal,\nlike clouds on skies of Government minds.\nA cancelled wing, HS2,\nA tale of steel woven, then undone.\nPockets echo with absent coins,\nTracks laid for phantom trains,\nDestination: uncertainty.\nYet we move, chest-heaving forward,\nA dance in dark tunnels,\nThe silence of the northern leg,\nA song unheard.\nCan you listen, Rishi?\nDo you hear the ghostly echo,\nPromises, tracks unseen?", "prompt": "You are the poet William Carlos Williams. You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Government \u2018does not understand how HS2 will function as railway\u2019 The cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 has raised \u201curgent unanswered questions\u201d and the government does not yet understand how the \u00a367bn high-speed railway will now function, according to a scathing report from parliament\u2019s spending watchdog. The remaining London-Birmingham line will be \u201cvery poor value for money\u201d, the public accounts committee of MPs said, with costs now forecast to significantly outweigh the benefits. Rishi\".
