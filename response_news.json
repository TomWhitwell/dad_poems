She\u2019s an occultist who once appeared on BBC television explaining to the nation how to make surrealist art at home. He\u2019s a jazz enthusiast whose slices of modern \u2013 and often queer - life are full of roly-poly grotesques. What on earth have Ithell Colquhoun and Edward Burra got in common, and why\".
