It is a shame, because there are some interesting visual ideas that go beyond route one filming.

But it\u2019s the post-production that is the biggest letdown: the sound mix is poor, and it\u2019s a real shame that the final image before the credits roll, which should be genuinely nasty, is derailed by risible FX. Lead actor Tony Cook endearingly saves anyone the bother of calling him the cheap version of Jason Statham by billing himself as exactly that in his social media bio \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty much what he is.
