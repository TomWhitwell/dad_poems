{"poem": "Title: \"Reflections of Gran's Refuse\"\n\nWhere once innocence danced amidst discards old, \nSpires of memory assembled in the refuse bold. \nIn the hearth's hearth, a childhood cast,\nThrough the chute of time, recollections vast. \nTo seize joy in the banal, thus I was taught,\nPreserving gran's lore in the crucible of thought. \nBearing age's furnace, in memory her presence shall hold.", "prompt": "You are the poet W.B.

The room had a chute that you could drop tied bags of household rubbish into, and they would travel down to a furnace somewhere.\".
