Yvette Cooper, the UK foreign secretary, said: \u201cFor 78-year-old Jimmy Lai, 20 years is an effective life sentence, following a politically motivated prosecution under a law that was imposed to silence China\u2019s critics. The Hong Kong authorities must end Jimmy Lai\u2019s appalling ordeal and release him to be with his family.\u201d His son Sebastien said Lai feared dying alone while his legal team called him the world\u2019s current highest profile political prisoner. The UN rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the verdict was incompatible with international law and must be quashed. \u201cThis outcome highlights how the vague and overly broad provisions of Hong Kong\u2019s national security legislation can lead to being interpreted and enforced in violation of Hong Kong\u2019s international human rights obligations,\u201d he said.
