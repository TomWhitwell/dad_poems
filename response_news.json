She disclosed in a legal document that last month FBI agents acting on an informant\u2019s tip-off searched a property in Isle of Wight, a county named after the island in the English Channel often described as rustic and quaint. What they found on the 20-acre farm\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
