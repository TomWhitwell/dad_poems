You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Little Am\u00e9lie review \u2013 tender and poignant study of the fragility of early childhood This tender and sweet animation from film-makers Ma\u00eflys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han is an involving, poignant study of early childhood; how fragile it is, and how strong you feel yourself to be to have outlived or surpassed it. It is based on the autobiographical novella The Character of Rain by Belgian author Am\u00e9lie Nothomb, published in 2000. Lo\u00efse Charpentier voices the role of Am\u00e9lie, a little girl living in Kobe, Japan, with her Belgian family in the late 60s; mum, dad and older brother and sister. Until the age of three, she was in a persistent vegetative state, but was miraculously jolted free of it by a terrifying earthquake; yet she emerges quarrelsome and almost feral, to the despair of her parents. That is until her elegant grandmother Claude (Cathy Cerda) comes to visit and gives her a piece of narcotically delicious white Belgian chocolate, which causes Am\u00e9lie to bloom into a lovely, biddable child who adores her Japanese nanny Nishio-san (Victoria Grosbois). But there are problems: the family\u2019s icily distant landlady Kashima-san (Yumi Fujimori) not-so-secretly detests her western tenants \u2013 and despises Nishio-san for working for them \u2013 due to unresolved feelings about allied bombings during the war. And what will happen when Am\u00e9lie\u2019s grandmother has to leave? And when the whole family have to leave Japan, which Am\u00e9lie now sees as her adored homeland? The animation itself is, in its way, a very charming\". Write a poem in YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE, no more than 60 words long.
