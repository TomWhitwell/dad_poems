{"poem": "**Downing Street, Distant Streets**\n\nThis morning the paper smells of London rain  \nand Tehran smoke.  \nWomen stand in exile, holding a country  \nlike a photograph kept in a wallet\u2014creased, kissed,  \nnot forgotten.  \nThey shout \"secular,\" \"plural,\"  \nas if naming daughters.  \nSomewhere 192 cities answer,  \nand a door, long bolted,  \nbegins to remember it can open.", "prompt": "You are the poet Billy Collins.

You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"\u2018Iranians are fed up of dictatorship\u2019: the exiled female activists daring to dream of a new era \u201cIn Europe, women are running countries. Women in Iran deserve that. They have always been a leading part of the resistance,\u201d Diana Nammi, a longtime campaigner against autocracy in Iran, says in London. Female activists and youth campaigners are at the forefront of the fight to shape a new direction for Iran after decades of repressive rule in the Islamic Republic. In the UK, exiled Iranian activists have also mobilised. Now, as mass protests engulf Iran, hopes are high among British Iranians that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s theocracy is finally about to be toppled.

The people of Iran are fed up of monarchical and clerical dictatorship,\u201d Jazayeri said at a protest in Downing Street, as women\u2019s voices shouted for democracy and freedom behind her. Opposition campaigners say the unrest has spread to 192 Iranian cities. Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed and thousands detained as the authorities try to cling to power. Jazayeri hopes the dissident politician Maryam Rajavi will become modern Iran\u2019s first female leader. \u201cThis time it\u2019s different because (the uprising) is well-organised,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a leadership, an alternative ready to take over.
