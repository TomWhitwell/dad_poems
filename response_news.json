You woke up this morning feeling creative. You have just read this story in the newspaper: \"Trump raises tariffs to 15% on imports from all countries Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he would raise a temporary tariff rate on US imports from all countries from 10% to 15%, less than 24 hours after the US supreme court ruled against the legality of his flagship trade policy. Infuriated by the high court\u2019s ruling on Friday that he had exceeded his authority and should have gotten congressional approval for the tariffs, the US president railed against the justices who blocked his use of tariffs, calling them a \u201cdisgrace to the nation\u201d, and ordered an immediate 10% tariff on all imports, in addition to any existing levies.

During that period, his administration will work on issuing new and \u201clegally permissible\u201d tariffs, Trump said. The president also attacked the supreme court\u2019s 6-3 ruling as \u201cridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American\u201d in his Truth Social\".
